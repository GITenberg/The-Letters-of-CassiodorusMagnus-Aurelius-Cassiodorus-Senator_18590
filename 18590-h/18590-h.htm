<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> abstract of the 'Variae' of Cassiodorus which I now offer to the
notice of historical students, belongs to that class of work which
Professor Max M&#252;ller happily characterised when he entitled two of his
volumes 'Chips from a German Workshop.' In the course of my
preparatory reading, before beginning the composition of the third and
fourth volumes of my book on 'Italy and Her Invaders,' I found it
necessary to study very attentively the 'Various Letters' of
Cassiodorus, our best and often our only source of information, for
the character and the policy of the great Theodoric. The notes which
in this process were accumulated upon my hands might, I hoped, be
woven into one long chapter on the Ostrogothic government of Italy.
When the materials were collected, however, they were so manifold, so
perplexing, so full of curious and unexpected detail, that I quite
despaired of ever succeeding in the attempt to group them into one
harmonious and artistic picture. Frankly, therefore, renouncing a task
which is beyond my powers, I offer my notes for the perusal of the few
readers who may care to study the mutual reactions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> of the Roman and
the Teutonic mind upon one another in the Sixth Century, and I ask
these to accept the artist's assurance, 'The curtain is the picture.'</p>

<p>It will be seen that I only profess to give an abstract, not a full
translation of the letters. There is so much repetition and such a
lavish expenditure of words in the writings of Cassiodorus, that they
lend themselves very readily to the work of the abbreviator. Of course
the longer letters generally admit of greater relative reduction in
quantity than the shorter ones, but I think it may be said that on an
average the letters have lost at least half their bulk in my hands. On
any important point the real student will of course refuse to accept
my condensed rendering, and will go straight to the fountain-head. I
hope, however, that even students may occasionally derive the same
kind of assistance from my labours which an astronomer derives from
the humble instrument called the 'finder' in a great observatory.</p>

<p>A few important letters have been translated, to the best of my
ability, verbatim. In the not infrequent instances where I have been
unable to extract any intelligible meaning, on grammatical principles,
from the words of my author, I have put in the text the nearest
approximation that I could discover to his meaning, and placed the
unintelligible words in a note, hoping that my readers may be more
fortunate in their interpretation than I have been.</p>

<p>With the usual ill-fortune of authors, just as my last sheet was
passing through the press I received from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> Italy a number of the 'Atti
e Memorie della R. Deputazione di Storia Patria per le Provincie di
Romagna' (to which I am a subscriber), containing an elaborate and
scholarlike article by S. Augusto Gaudenzi, entitled 'L'Opera di
Cassiodorio a Ravenna.' It is a satisfaction to me to see that in
several instances S. Gaudenzi and I have reached practically the same
conclusions; but I cannot but regret that his paper reached me too
late to prevent my benefiting from it more fully. A few of the more
important points in which I think S. Gaudenzi throws useful light on
our common subject are noticed in the '<a href="#ADDITIONS_AND_CORRECTIONS">Additions and Corrections</a>,' to
which I beg to draw my readers' attention.</p>

<p>I may perhaps be allowed to add that the <a href="#GENERAL_INDEX">Index</a>, the preparation of
which has cost me no small amount of labour, ought (if I have not
altogether failed in my endeavour) to be of considerable assistance to
the historical enquirer. For instance, if he will refer to the heading
<i><a href="#Sajo">Sajo</a></i>, and consult the passages there referred to, he will find, I
believe, all that Cassiodorus has to tell us concerning these
interesting personages, the Sajones, who were almost the only
representatives of the intrusive Gothic element in the fabric of Roman
administration.</p>

<p>From textual criticism and the discussion of the authority of
different MSS. I have felt myself entirely relieved by the
announcement of the forthcoming critical edition of the 'Variae,'
under the superintendence of Professor Meyer. The task to which an
eminent German scholar has devoted the labour of several years, it
would be quite useless for me, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> appliances and without special
training, to approach as an amateur; and I therefore simply help
myself to the best reading that I can get from the printed texts,
leaving to Professor Meyer to say which reading possesses the highest
diplomatic authority. Simply as a a matter of curiosity I have spent
some days in examining the MSS. of Cassiodorus in the British Museum.
If they are at all fair representatives (which probably they are not)
of the MSS. which Professor Meyer has consulted, I should say that
though the titles of the letters have often got into great confusion
through careless and unintelligent copying, the main text is not
likely to show any very important variations from the editions of
Nivellius and Garet.</p>

<p>I now commend this volume with all its imperfections to the indulgent
criticism of the small class of historical students who alone will
care to peruse it. The man of affairs and the practical politician
will of course not condescend to turn over its pages; yet the anxious
and for a time successful efforts of Theodoric and his Minister to
preserve to Italy the blessings of <i>Civilitas</i> might perhaps teach
useful lessons even to a modern statesman.</p>

<h2><a name="NOTE" id="NOTE"></a>NOTE.</h2>


<p>The following Note as to the MSS. at the British Museum may save a
future enquirer a little trouble.</p>

<p>(1) 10 B. XV. is a MS. about 11 inches by 8, written in a fine bold
hand, and fills 157 folios, of which 134 belong to the 'Variae' and 23
to the 'Institutiones Divinarum Litterarum.' There are also two folios
at the end which I have not deciphered. The MS. is assigned to the
Thirteenth Century. The title of the <a href="#BOOK_I">First</a> Book is interesting,
because it contains the description of Cassiodorus' official rank, 'Ex
Magistri Officii,' which Mommsen seems to have looked for in the MSS.
in vain. The MS. contains the first Three Books complete, but only 39
letters of the <a href="#BOOK_IV">Fourth</a>. Letters <a href="#iv40">40</a>-51 of the
<a href="#BOOK_IV">Fourth Book</a>, and the whole
of the <a href="#BOOK_V">Fifth</a>, <a href="#BOOK_VI">Sixth</a>, and
<a href="#BOOK_VII">Seventh</a> Books, are missing. It then goes on
to the <a href="#BOOK_VIII">Eighth</a> Book (which it calls the Fifth), but omits the first
five letters. The remaining 28 appear to be copied satisfactorily. The
<a href="#BOOK_IX">Ninth</a>, <a href="#BOOK_X">Tenth</a>, <a href="#BOOK_XI">Eleventh</a>, and
<a href="#BOOK_XII">Twelfth</a> Books, which the transcriber calls
the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth, seem to be on the whole
correctly copied.</p>

<p>There seems to be a certain degree of correspondence between the
readings of this MS. and those of the Leyden MS. of the Twelfth
Century (formerly at Fulda) which are described by Ludwig Tross in his
'Symbolae Criticae' (Hammone, 1853).</p>

<p>(2) 8 B. XIX. is a MS. also of the Thirteenth Century, in a smaller
hand than the foregoing. The margins are very large, but the Codex
measures only 6-3/4 inches by 4-1/4. The rubricated titles are of
somewhat later date than the body of the text. The initial letters are
elaborately illuminated. This MS. contains, in a mutilated state and
in a peculiar order, the books from the <a href="#BOOK_VIII">Eighth</a> to the <a href="#BOOK_XII">Twelfth</a>. The
following is the order in which the books are placed:</p>


<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="books">

<p>The amanuensis, who has evidently been a thoroughly dishonest worker,
constantly omits whole letters, from which however he sometimes
extracts a sentence or two, which he tacks on to the end of some
preceding letter without regard to the sense. This process makes it
exceedingly difficult to collate the MS. with the printed text. Owing
to the <a href="#BOOK_VIII">Eighth</a> Book being inserted after the
<a href="#BOOK_XII">Twelfth</a>, it is erroneously
labelled on the back, 'Cassiodori Senatoris Epistolae, Lib. X-XIII.'</p>

<p>(3) 10 B. IV. (also of the Thirteenth Century, and measuring 11 inches
by 8) contains, in a tolerably complete state, the first Three Books
of the 'Variae,' <a href="#BOOK_IV">Book IV.</a> <a href="#iv5">5</a>-39,
<a href="#BOOK_VIII">Book VIII.</a> <a href="#viii1">1</a>-12, and Books
<a href="#BOOK_X">X</a>-XII. The
order, however, is transposed, Books <a href="#BOOK_IV">IV.</a> and
<a href="#BOOK_VIII">VIII.</a> coming after Book
<a href="#BOOK_XII">XII.</a> These excerpts from Cassiodorus, which occupy folios 66 to 134 of
the MS., are preceded by some collections relative to the Civil and
Canon Law. The letters which are copied seem to be carefully and
conscientiously done.</p>

<p>These three MSS. are all in the King's Library.</p>

<p>Besides these MSS. I have also glanced at No. 1,919 in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford. Like those previously described it is, I believe,
of the Thirteenth Century, and professes to contain the whole of the
'Variae;' but the letters are in an exceedingly mutilated form. On an
average it seems to me that not more than one-third of each letter is
copied. In this manner the 'Variae' are compressed into the otherwise
impossible number of 33 folios (149-182).</p>

<p>All these MSS., even the best of them, give me the impression of being
copied by very unintelligent scribes, who had but little idea of the
meaning of the words which they were transcribing. In all, the
superscription V.S. is expanded (wrongly, as I believe) into 'Viro
Senatori;' for 'Praefecto Praetorio' we have the meaningless
'Praeposito;' and the Agapitus who is addressed in the <a href="#i6">6th</a>,
<a href="#i32">32nd</a>, and
<a href="#i33">33rd</a> letters of the <a href="#BOOK_I">First Book</a> is turned, in defiance of chronology,
into a Pope.</p>

however, that Garet is right in restoring 'Praefecto Praetorio.'</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<h3>LIFE OF CASSIODORUS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> interest of the life of Cassiodorus is derived from his position
rather than from his character. He was a statesman of considerable
sagacity and of unblemished honour, a well-read scholar, and a devout
Christian; but he was apt to crouch before the possessors of power
however unworthy, and in the whole of his long and eventful life we
never find him playing a part which can be called heroic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of Cassiodorus on the confines of the Ancient and
the Modern.</div>

<p>His position, however, which was in more senses than one that of a
borderer between two worlds, gives to the study of his writings an
exceptional value. Born a few years after the overthrow of the Western
Empire, a Roman noble by his ancestry, a rhetorician-philosopher by
his training, he became what we should call the Prime Minister of the
Ostrogothic King Theodoric; he toiled with his master at the
construction of the new state, which was to unite the vigour of
Germany and the culture of Rome; for a generation he saw this edifice
stand, and when it fell beneath the blows of Belisarius he retired,
perhaps well-nigh broken-hearted, from the political arena. The
writings of such a man could hardly fail, at any rate they do not
fail, to give us many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> interesting glimpses into the political life
both of the Romans and the Barbarians. It is true that they throw more
light backwards than forwards, that they teach us far more about the
constitution of the Roman Empire than they do about the Teutonic
customs from whence in due time Feudalism was to be born. Still, they
do often illustrate these Teutonic usages; and when we remember that
the writer to whom after Tacitus we are most deeply indebted for our
knowledge of Teutonic antiquity, Jordanes, professedly compiled his
ill-written pamphlet from the Twelve Books of the Gothic History of
Cassiodorus, we see that indirectly his contribution to the history of
the German factor in European civilisation is a most important one.</p>

<p>Thus then, as has been already said, Cassiodorus stood on the confines
of two worlds, the Ancient and the Modern; indeed it is a noteworthy
fact that the very word <i>modernus</i> occurs for the first time with any
frequency in his writings. Or, if the ever-shifting boundary between
Ancient and Modern be drawn elsewhere than in the fifth and sixth
centuries, at any rate it is safe to say, that he stood on the
boundary of two worlds, the Roman and the Teutonic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Also on the confines of Politics and Religion.</div>

<p>But the statesman who, after spending thirty years at the Court of
Theodoric and his daughter, spent thirty-three years more in the
monastery which he had himself erected at Squillace, was a borderer in
another sense than that already mentioned&#8212;a borderer between the two
worlds of Politics and Religion; and in this capacity also, as the
contemporary, perhaps the friend, certainly the imitator, of St.
Benedict, and in some respects the improver upon his method,
Cassiodorus largely helped to mould the destinies of mediaeval and
therefore of modern Europe.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to indicate the chief points in the life and
career of Cassiodorus. Where, as is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> the case, our
information comes from his own correspondence, I shall, to avoid
repetition, not do much more than refer the reader to the passage in
the following collection, where he will find the information given as
nearly as may be in the words of the great Minister himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His ancestors.</div>

<p>The ancestors of Cassiodorus for three generations, and their public
employments, are enumerated for us in the letters (Var. <a href="#i3">i. 3</a>-4) which
in the name of Theodoric he wrote on his father's elevation to the
Patriciate. From these letters we learn that&#8212;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great grandfather.</div>

<p>(1) Cassiodorus, the writer's great grandfather, who held the rank of
an Illustris, defended the shores of Sicily and Bruttii from the
incursions of the Vandals. This was probably between 430 and 440, and,
as we may suppose, towards the end of the life of this statesman, to
whom we may conjecturally assign a date from 390 to 460.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grandfather.</div>

<p>(2) His son and namesake, the grandfather of our Cassiodorus, was a
Tribune (a military rank nearly corresponding to our 'Colonel') and
Notarius under Valentinian III. He enjoyed the friendship of the great
Aetius, and was sent with Carpilio the son of that statesman on an
embassy to Attila, probably between the years 440 and 450. In this
embassy, according to his grandson, he exerted an extraordinary
influence over the mind of the Hunnish King. Soon after this he
retired to his native Province of Bruttii, where he passed the
remainder of his days. We may probably fix the limits of his life from
about 420 to 490.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Father.</div>

<p>(3) His son, the third Cassiodorus, our author's father, served under
Odovacar (therefore between 476 and 492), as Comes Privatarum Rerum
and Comes Sacrarum Largitionum. These two offices, one of which
nominally involved the care of the domains of the Sovereign and the
other the regulation of his private charities, were in fact the two
great financial offices of the Empire and of the barbarian royalties
which modelled their system upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> it. Upon the fall of the throne of
Odovacar, Cassiodorus transferred his services to Theodoric, at the
beginning of whose reign he acted as Governor (Consularis<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>) of
Sicily. In this capacity he showed much tact and skill, and thereby
succeeded in reconciling the somewhat suspicious and intractable
Sicilians to the rule of their Ostrogothic master. He next
administered (as Corrector<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>) his own native Province of 'Bruttii et
Lucania<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.' Either in the year 500 or soon after, he received from
Theodoric the highest mark of his confidence that the Sovereign could
bestow, being raised to the great place of Praetorian Praefect, which
still conferred a semi-regal splendour upon its holder, and which
possibly under a Barbarian King may have involved yet more
participation in the actual work of reigning than it had done under a
Roman Emperor.</p>

<p>The Praefecture of this Cassiodorus probably lasted three or four
years, and at its close he received the high honour of the Patriciate.
We are not able to name the exact date of his retirement from office;
but the important point for us is, that while he still held this
splendid position his son was first introduced to public life. To that
son's history we may now proceed, for we have no further information
of importance as to the father's old age or death beyond the
intimation (contained in Var. <a href="#iii28">iii. 28</a>) that Theodoric invited him,
apparently in vain, to leave his beloved Bruttii and return to the
Court of Ravenna.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator</span> was born at Scyllacium
(<i>Squillace</i>) about the year 480. His name, his birthplace, and his
year of birth will each require a short notice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Name.</div>

<p>(1) <i>Name.</i> Magnus (not Marcus, as it has been sometimes incorrectly
printed) is the author's praenomen. Aurelius, the gentile name,
connects him with a large gens, of which Q. Aurelius Memmius Symmachus
was one of the most distinguished ornaments. <span class="sidenote">Cassiodorus, or Cassiodorius.</span>As to the form of the
cognomen there is a good deal of diversity of opinion, the majority of
German scholars preferring Cassiodor<i>i</i>us to Cassiodorus. The argument
in favour of the former spelling is derived from the fact that some of
the MSS. of his works (not apparently the majority) write the name
with the termination <i>rius</i>, and that while it is easy to understand
how from the genitive form <i>ri</i> a nominative <i>rus</i> might be wrongly
inferred instead of the real nominative <i>rius</i>, it is not easy to see
why the opposite mistake should be made, and <i>rius</i> substituted for
the genuine <i>rus</i>.</p>

<p>The question will probably be decided one way or the other by the
critical edition of the 'Variae' which is to be published among the
'Monumenta Germaniae Historica;' but in the meantime it may be
remarked that the correct Greek form of the name as shown by
inscriptions appears to be Cassiodo<i>rus</i>, and that in a poem of
Alcuin's<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> occurs the line</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Cassiodorus item Chrysostomus atque Johannes,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>showing that the termination <i>rus</i> was generally accepted as early as
the eighth century. It is therefore to be hoped that this is the form
which may finally prevail.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Senator.</div>

<p>Senator, it is clear, was part of the original name of Cassiodorus,
and not a title acquired by sitting in the Roman Senate. It seems a
curious custom to give a title of this kind to an infant as part of
his name, but the well-known instance of Patricius (St. Patrick) shows
that this was sometimes done, and there are other instances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
(collected by Thorbecke, p. 34) of this very title Senator being used
as a proper name.</p>

<p>It is clear from Jordanes (who calls the Gothic History of Cassiodorus
'duodecem Senatoris volumina de origine actibusque Getarum<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>'), from
Pope Vigilius (who speaks of 'religiosum virum filium nostrum
Senatorem<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>'), from the titles of the letters written by
Cassiodorus<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, and from his punning allusions to his own name and the
love to the Senate which it had prophetically expressed, that Senator
was a real name and not a title of honour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Birthplace, Scyllacium.</div>

<p>(2) Scyllacium, the modern Squillace, was, according to Cassiodorus,
the first, either in age or in importance, of the cities of Bruttii, a
Province which corresponds pretty closely with the modern Calabria. It
is situated at the head of the gulf to which it gives its name, on the
eastern side of Italy, and at the point where the peninsula is pinched
in by the Tyrrhene and Ionian Seas to a width of only fifteen miles,
the narrowest dimensions to which it is anywhere reduced. The Apennine
chain comes here within a distance of about five miles of the sea, and
upon one of its lower dependencies Scyllacium was placed. The slight
promontory in front of the town earned for it from the author of the
Aeneid the ominous name of 'Navifragum Scylaceum<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.' In the
description which Cassiodorus himself gives of his birthplace (Var.
<a href="#xii15">xii. 15</a>) we hear nothing of the danger to mariners which had attracted
the attention of Virgil, possibly a somewhat timid sailor. The name,
however, given to the place by the Greek colonists who founded it, <b>
<i><a href="#err1">Scylletium</a></i></b>, is thought by some to contain an allusion to dangers of
the coast similar to those which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> typified by the barking dogs of
the not far distant Scylla.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Greek city.</div>

<p>According to Cassiodorus, this Greek city was founded by Ulysses after
the destruction of Troy. Strabo<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> attributes the foundation of it to
the almost equally widespread energy of Menestheus. The form of the
name makes it probable that the colonists were in any case of Ionian
descent; but in historic times we find Scylletion subject to the
domineering Achaian city of Crotona, from whose grasp it was wrested
(<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 389) by the elder Dionysius. It no doubt shared in the general
decay of the towns of this part of Magna Graecia consequent on the
wars of Dionysius and Agathocles, and may very probably, like Crotona,
have been taken and laid waste by the Bruttian banditti in the Second
Punic War. During the latter part of this war Hannibal seems to have
occupied a position near to, but not in, the already ruined city, and
its port was known long after as Castra Hannibalis<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Roman colony.</div>

<p><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
'A century before the end of the Republic, a city much more
considerable than that which had existed in the past was again
established near the point where the Greek Scylletion had existed.
Among the colonies of Roman citizens founded <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 123 on the rogation
of Caius Gracchus, was one sent to this part of Bruttii, under the
name of Colonia Minervia Scolacium, a name parallel to those of
Colonia Neptunia Tarentum and Colonia Junonia Karthago, decided on at
the same time. <i>Scolacium</i> is the form that we meet with in Velleius
Paterculus, and that is found in an extant Latin inscription of the
time of Antoninus Pius. This is the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> Latin form of the name of the
town. <i>Scylacium</i>, which first appears as used by the writers of the
first century of our era, is a purely literary form springing from the
desire to get nearer to the Greek type <i>Scylletion</i>.</p>

<p>'Scolacium, or Scylacium, a town purely Roman by reason of the origin
of its first colonists, was from its earliest days an important city,
and remained such till the end of the Empire. Pomponius Mela, Strabo,
Pliny, and Ptolemy speak of it as one of the principal cities of
Bruttii. It had for its port Castra Hannibalis. Under Nero its
population was strengthened by a new settlement of veterans as
colonists. The city then took the names of Colonia Minervia Nervia
Augusta Scolacium. We read these names in an inscription discovered in
1762 at 1,800 metres from the modern Squillace, between that city and
the sea&#8212;an inscription which mentions the construction of an aqueduct
bringing water to Scolacium, executed 143 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> at the cost of the
Emperor Antoninus.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appearance of the city at the time of Cassiodorus.</div>

<p>For the appearance of this Roman colony in the seventh century of its
existence the reader is referred to the letter of Cassiodorus before
quoted (Var. <a href="#xii15">xii. 15</a>). The picture of the city, 'hanging like a
cluster of grapes upon the hills, basking in the brightness of the sun
all day long, yet cooled by the breezes from the sea, and looking at
her leisure on the labours of the husbandman in the corn-fields, the
vineyards, and the olive-groves around her,' is an attractive one, and
shows that kind of appreciation of the gentler beauties of Nature
which befits a countryman of Virgil.</p>

<p>This picture, however, is not distinctive enough to enable us from it
alone to fix the exact site of the Roman city. Lenormant (pp.
360-370), while carefully distinguishing between the sites of the
Greek Scylletion and the Latin Scolacium, and assigning the former
with much apparent probability to the neighbourhood of the promontory
and the Grotte di Stalletti, has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> probably too hasty in his
assertion that the modern city of Squillace incontestably covers the
ground of the Latin Scolacium. Mr. Arthur J. Evans, after making a
much more careful survey of the place and its neighbourhood than the
French archaeologist had leisure for, has come to the conclusion that
in this identification M. Lenormant is entirely wrong, and that the
Roman city was not at Squillace, where there are no remains of earlier
than mediaeval times, but at Roccella del Vescovo, five or six miles
from Squillace in a north-easterly direction, where there are such
remains as can only have belonged to a Roman provincial city of the
first rank. For a further discussion of the question the reader is
referred to the <a href="#NOTE_ON_THE_TOPOGRAPHY_OF_SQUILLACE">Note</a> (and accompanying Map) at the end of this
chapter.</p>

<p>We pass on from considering the place of Cassiodorus' birth to
investigate the date of that event.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Date of birth.</div>

<p>(3) The only positive statement that we possess as to the birth-year
of Cassiodorus comes from a very late and somewhat unsatisfactory
source. John Trittheim (or Trithemius), Abbot of the Benedictine
Monastery of Spanheim, who died in 1516, was one of the ecclesiastical
scholars of the Renaissance period, and composed, besides a multitude
of other books, a treatise 'De Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis,' in which
is found this notice of Cassiodorus<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>:&#8212;</p>

paene finem, annos habens aetatis plus quam 95, Anno Domini 575.'</p>

<p>This notice is certainly not one to which we should attach much
importance if it contradicted earlier and trustworthy authorities, or
if there were any internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> evidence against it. But if this cannot be
asserted, it is not desirable entirely to discard the assertion of a
scholar who, in the age of the Renaissance and before the havoc
wrought among the monasteries of Germany by the Thirty Years' War, may
easily have had access to some sources which are now no longer
available.</p>

<p>When we examine the information which is thus given us, we find it
certainly somewhat vague. 'Cassiodorus was illustrious' (no doubt as a
writer, since it is 'ecclesiastici scriptores' of whom Trittheim is
speaking) 'in the time of Justin the Elder [518-527] down nearly to
the end of the reign of Justin the Younger [565-578], attaining to
more than 95 years of age in the year of our Lord 575.' But on
reflection we see that the meaning must be that Cassiodorus died in
575 (which agrees well with the words 'paene finem imperii Justini
junioris'), and that when he died he was some way on in his 96th year,
or as we say colloquially 'ninety-five off.' The marvel of his
attaining such an age is no doubt the reason for inserting the 'plus
quam,' to show that he did not die immediately after his 95th
birthday. If this notice be trustworthy, therefore, we may place the
birth of Cassiodorus in 479 or 480.</p>

<p>Now upon examining all the facts in our possession as to his career as
a statesman and an author, and especially our latest acquired
information<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, we find that they do in a remarkable manner agree
with Trittheim's date, while we have no positive statement by any
author early or late which really conflicts with it.</p>

<p>The only shadow of an argument that has been advanced for a different
and earlier date is so thin that it is difficult to state without
confuting it. In some editions of the works of Cassiodorus there
appears a very short anonymous tract on the method of determining
Easter, called 'Computus Paschalis,' and composed in 562. In the
'Orthographi&#226;,' which was undoubtedly written by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> Cassiodorus at the
age of 93, and which contains a list of his previously published
works, no mention is made of this 'Computus.' It must therefore, say
the supporters of the theory, have been written after he was 93. He
must have been at least 94 in 562, and the year of his birth must be
put back at least to 468. In this argument there are two absolutely
worthless links. There is no evidence to show that the 'Computus
Paschalis' came from the pen of Cassiodorus at all, but much reason to
think that Pithoeus, the editor who first published it under his name,
was mistaken in doing so. And if it were his, a little memorandum like
this&#8212;only two pages long, and with no literary pretension
whatever&#8212;we may almost say with certainty would <i>not</i> be included by
the veteran author in the enumeration of his theological works
prefixed to his 'Orthographi&#226;.'</p>

<p>The reason why a theory founded on such an absurdly weak basis has
held its ground at all, has probably been that it buttressed up
another obvious fallacy. A whole school of biographers of Cassiodorus
and commentators on his works has persisted, in spite of the plainest
evidence of his letters, in identifying him with his father, who bore
office under Odovacar (476-493). To do this it was necessary to get
rid of the date 480 for the birth of Cassiodorus Senator, and to throw
back that event as far as possible. And yet, not even by pushing it
back to 468, do they make it reasonably probable that a person, who
was only a child of eight years old at Odovacar's accession, could in
the course of his short reign (the last four years of which were
filled by his struggle with Theodoric) have held the various high
offices which were really held during that reign by the father of
Senator.</p>

<p>We assume therefore with some confidence the year 480 as the
approximate date of the birth of our author; and while we observe that
this date fits well with those which the course of history induces us
to assign to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> ancestors in the three preceding generations<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, we
also note with interest that it was, as nearly as we can ascertain,
the year of the birth of two of the most distinguished contemporaries
of Cassiodorus&#8212;Boethius and Benedict.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education of Cassiodorus.</div>

<p>Of the training and education of the young Senator we can only speak
from their evident results as displayed in the 'Variae,' to which the
reader is accordingly referred. It may be remarked, however, that
though he evidently received the usual instruction in philosophy and
rhetoric which was given to a young Roman noble aspiring to employment
in the Civil Service, there are some indications that the bent of his
own genius was towards Natural History, strange and often laughable as
are the facts or fictions which this taste of his has caused him to
accumulate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consiliarius to his father.</div>

<p>In the year 500<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, when Senator had just attained the age of twenty,
his father, as we have already seen, received from Theodoric the high
office of Praetorian Praefect. As a General might make an
<i>Aide-de-camp</i> of his son, so the Praefect conferred upon the young
Senator the post of <i>Consiliarius</i>, or Assessor in his Court<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. The
Consiliarius<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> had been in the time of the Republic an experienced
jurist who sat beside the Praetor or the Consul (who might be a man
quite unversed in the law) and advised him as to his judgments. From
the time of Severus onwards he became a paid functionary of the Court,
receiving a salary which varied from 12 to 72 solidi (&#163;7 to &#163;43). At
the time which we are now describing it was customary for the Judge to
choose his Consiliarius from among the ranks of young jurists who had
just completed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> their studies. The great legal school of Berytus
especially furnished a large number of Consiliarii to the Roman
Governors. In order to prevent an officer in this position from
obtaining an undue influence over the mind of his principal, the
latter was forbidden by law to keep a Consiliarius, who was a native
of the Province in which he was administering justice, more than four
months in his employ<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. This provision, of course, would not apply
when the young Assessor, as in the case of Cassiodorus, came with his
father from a distant Province: and in such a case, if the Magistrate
died during his year of office, by a special enactment the
fairly-earned pay of the Assessor was protected from unjust demands on
the part of the Exchequer<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. The functions thus exercised by Senator
in his father's court at Rome, and the title which he bore, were
somewhat similar to those which Procopius held in the camp of
Belisarius, but doubtless required a more thorough legal training. In
our own system, if we could imagine the Judge's Marshal invested with
the responsibilities of a Registrar of the Court, we should perhaps
get a pretty fair idea of the position and duties of a Roman
Consiliarius<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Panegyric on Theodoric.</div>

<p>It was while Cassiodorus was holding this agreeable but not important
position, that the opportunity came to him, by his dexterous use of
which he sprang at one bound into the foremost ranks of the official
hierarchy. On some public occasion it fell to his lot to deliver an
oration in praise of Theodoric<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, and he did this with such
admirable eloquence&#8212;admirable according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> depraved taste of the
time&#8212;that Theodoric at once bestowed upon the orator, still in the
first dawn of manhood<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, <span class="sidenote">Appointed Quaestor.</span>the 'Illustrious' office of Quaestor,
giving him thereby what we should call Cabinet-rank, and placing him
among the ten or eleven ministers of the highest class<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, by whom,
under the King, the fortunes of the Gothic-Roman State were absolutely
controlled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature of the Quaestor's office.</div>

<p>The Quaestor's duty required him to be beyond all other Ministers the
mouthpiece of the Sovereign. In the 'Notitia<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>' the matters under
his control are concisely stated to be 'Laws which are to be dictated,
and Petitions.'</p>

<p>To him therefore was assigned the duty (which the British Parliament
in its folly assigns to no one) of giving a final revision to the laws
which received the Sovereign's signature, and seeing that they were
consistent with one another and with previous enactments, and were
clothed in fitting language. He replied in the Sovereign's name to the
petitions which were presented to him. He also, as we learn from
Cassiodorus, had audience with the ambassadors of foreign powers, to
whom he addressed suitable and stately harangues, or through whom he
forwarded written replies to the letters which they had brought, but
always of course speaking or writing in the name of his master. In the
performance of these duties he had chiefly to rely on his own
intellectual resources as a trained jurist and rhetorician.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> The large
official staff which waited upon the nod of the other great Ministers
of State was absent from his apartments<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>; but for the mere manual
work of copying, filing correspondence, and the like, he could summon
the needful number of clerks from the four great bureaux (scrinia)
which were under the control of the Master of the Offices.</p>

<p>We have an interesting summary of the Quaestor's duties and privileges
from the pen of Cassiodorus himself in the 'Variae' (vi. 5), under the
title 'Formula Quaesturae,' and to this document I refer the reader
who wishes to complete the picture of the occupations in which the
busiest years of the life of Cassiodorus were passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Special utility of a Quaestor to Theodoric.</div>

<p>To a ruler in Theodoric's position the acquisition of such a Quaestor
as Cassiodorus was a most fortunate event. He himself was doubtless
unable to speak or to write Latin with fluency. According to the
common story, which passes current on the authority of the 'Anonymus
Valesii,' he never could learn to write, and had to 'stencil' his
signature. I look upon this story with some suspicion, especially
because it is also told of his contemporary, the Emperor Justin; but I
have no doubt that such literary education as Theodoric ever received
was Greek rather than Latin, being imparted during the ten years of
his residence as a hostage at Constantinople. Years of marches and
countermarches, of battle and foray, at the head of his Ostrogothic
warriors, may well have effaced much of the knowledge thus acquired.
At any rate, when he descended the Julian Alps, close upon forty years
of age, and appeared for the first time in Italy to commence his long
and terrible duel with Odovacar, it was too late to learn the language
of her sons in such fashion that the first sentence spoken by him in
the Hall of Audience should not betray him to his new subjects as an
alien and a barbarian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet Theodoric was by no means indifferent to the power of well-spoken
words, by no means unconcerned as to the opinion which his
Latin-speaking subjects held concerning him. He was no Cambyses or
Timour, ruling by the sword alone. His proud title was 'Gothorum
Romanorumque Rex,' and the ideal of his hopes, successfully realised
during the greater part of his long and tranquil reign, was to be
equally the King of either people. He had been fortunate thus far in
his Praetorian Praefects. Liberius, a man of whom history knows too
little, had amid general applause steered the vessel of the State for
the first seven years of the new reign. The elder Cassiodorus, who had
succeeded him, seemed likely to follow the same course. But possibly
Theodoric had begun to feel the necessity laid upon all rulers of men,
not only to be, but also to seem, anxious for the welfare of their
subjects. Possibly some dull, unsympathetic Quaestor had failed to
present the generous thoughts of the King in a sufficiently attractive
shape to the minds of the people. This much at all events we know,
that when the young Consiliarius, high-born, fluent, and learned,
poured forth his stream of panegyric on 'Our Lord Theodoric'&#8212;a
panegyric which, to an extent unusual with these orations, reflected
the real feelings of the speaker, and all the finest passages of which
were the genuine outcome of his own enthusiasm&#8212;the great Ostrogoth
recognised at once the man whom he was in want of to be the exponent
of his thoughts to the people, and by one stroke of wise audacity
turned the boyish and comparatively obscure Assessor into the
Illustrious Quaestor, one of the great personages of his realm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Composition of the VARIAE.</div>

<p>The monument of the official life of Cassiodorus is the correspondence
styled the 'Variae,' of which an abstract is now submitted to the
reader. There is no need to say much here, either as to the style or
the thoughts of these letters; a perusal of a few pages of the
abstract will give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> a better idea of both than an elaborate
description. The style is undoubtedly a bad one, whether it be
compared with the great works of Greek and Latin literature or with
our own estimate of excellence in speech. <span class="sidenote">Their style.</span>Scarcely ever do we find a
thought clothed in clear, precise, closely-fitting words, or a
metaphor which really corresponds to the abstract idea that is
represented by it. We take up sentence after sentence of verbose and
flaccid Latin, analyse them with difficulty, and when at last we come
to the central thought enshrouded in them, we too often find that it
is the merest and most obvious commonplace, a piece of tinsel wrapped
in endless folds of tissue paper. Perhaps from one point of view the
study of the style of Cassiodorus might prove useful to a writer of
English, as indicating the faults which he has in this age most
carefully to avoid. Over and over again, when reading newspaper
articles full of pompous words borrowed from Latin through French,
when wearied with 'velleities' and 'solidarities' and 'altruisms' and
'homologators,' or when vainly endeavouring to discover the real
meaning which lies hidden in a jungle of Parliamentary verbiage, I
have said to myself, remembering my similar labour upon the 'Variae,'
'How like this is to Cassiodorus.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lack of humour.</div>

<p>Intellectually one of the chief deficiencies of our author&#8212;a
deficiency in which perhaps his age and nation participated&#8212;was a
lack of humour. It is difficult to think that anyone who possessed a
keen sense of humour could have written letters so drolly unsuited to
the character of Theodoric, their supposed author, as are some which
we find in the 'Variae.' For instance, the King had reason to complain
that Faustus, the Praetorian Praefect, was dawdling over the execution
of an order which he had received for the shipment of corn from the
regions of Calabria and Apulia to Rome. We find the literary Quaestor
putting such words as these into the mouth of Theodoric, when
reprimanding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> lazy official<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>: <span class="sidenote">The letter about the sucking-fish.</span>'Why is there such great delay in
sending your swift ships to traverse the tranquil seas? Though the
south wind blows and the rowers are bending to their oars, has the
sucking-fish<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> fixed its teeth into the hulls through the liquid
waves; or have the shells of the Indian Sea, whose quiet touch is said
to hold so firmly that the angry billows cannot loosen it, with like
power fixed their lips into your keels? Idle stands the bark though
winged by swelling sails; the wind favours her but she makes no way;
she is fixed without an anchor, she is bound without a cable; and
these tiny animals hinder more than all such prospering circumstances
can help. Thus, though the loyal wave may be hastening its course, we
are informed that the ship stands fixed on the surface of the sea, and
by a strange paradox the swimmer [the ship] is made to remain
immovable while the wave is hurried along by movements numberless. Or,
to describe the nature of another kind of fish, perchance the sailors
in the aforesaid ships have grown dull and torpid by the touch of the
torpedo, by which such a deadly chill is struck into the right hand of
him who attacks it, that even through the spear by which it is itself
wounded, it gives a shock which causes the hand of the striker to
remain, though still a living substance, senseless and immovable. I
think some such misfortunes as these must have happened to men who are
unable to move their own bodies. But I know that in their case the
echeneis is corruption trading on delays; the bite of the Indian
shell-fish is insatiable cupidity; the torpedo is fraudulent pretence.
With perverted ingenuity they manufacture delays that they may seem to
have met with a run of ill-luck. Wherefore let your Greatness, whom it
specially concerns to look after such men as these, by a speedy rebuke
bring them to a better mind. Else the famine which we fear, will be
imputed not to the barrenness of the times but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> official
negligence, whose true child it will manifestly appear.'</p>

<p>It is not likely that Theodoric ever read a letter like this before
affixing to it his (perhaps stencilled) signature. If he did, he must
surely have smiled to see his few angry Teutonic words transmuted into
this wonderful rhapsody about sucking-fishes and torpedoes and
shell-fish in the Indian Sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of Cassiodorus.</div>

<p>The French proverb 'Le style c'est l'homme,' is not altogether true as
to the character of Cassiodorus. From his inflated and tawdry style we
might have expected to find him an untrustworthy friend and an
inefficient administrator. This, however, was not the case. As was
before said, his character was not heroic; he was, perhaps, inclined
to humble himself unduly before mere power and rank, and he had the
fault, common to most rhetoricians, of over-estimating the power of
words and thinking that a few fluent platitudes would heal inveterate
discords and hide disastrous blunders. But when we have said this we
have said the worst. He was, as far as we have any means of judging, a
loyal subject, a faithful friend, a strenuous and successful
administrator, and an exceptionally far-sighted statesman. His right
to this last designation rests upon the part which he bore in the
establishment of the Italian Kingdom 'of the Goths and Romans,'
founded by the great Theodoric.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His work in seconding the policy of Theodoric.</div>

<p>Theodoric, it must always be remembered, had entered Italy not
ostensibly as an invader but as a deliverer. He came in pursuance of a
compact with the legitimate Emperor of the New Rome, to deliver the
Elder Rome and the land of Italy from the dominion of 'the upstart
King of Rugians and Turcilingians<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>,' Odovacar. The compact, it is
true, was loose and indefinite, and contained within itself the germs
of that misunderstanding which, forty-seven years later, was developed
into a terrible war. Still, for the present, Theodoric, King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> the
Ostrogoths, was also in some undefined way legitimate representative
of the Old Roman Empire within the borders of Italy. This double
aspect of his rule was illustrated by that which (rather than the
doubtful Rex Italiae) seems to have been his favourite title,
'Gothorum Romanorumque Rex.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theodoric's love of <i>Civilitas</i>.</div>

<p>The great need of Italy was peace. After a century of wars and rumours
of wars; after Alaric, Attila, and Gaiseric had wasted her fields or
sacked her capital; after she had been exhausting her strength in
hopeless efforts to preserve the dominion of Gaul, Spain, and Africa;
after she had groaned under the exactions of the insolent <i>foederati</i>,
Roman soldiers only in name, who followed the standards of Ricimer or
Odovacar, she needed peace and to be governed with a strong hand, in
order to recover some small part of her old material prosperity. These
two blessings, peace and a strong government, Theodoric's rule ensured
to her. The theory of his government was this, that the two nations
should dwell side by side, not fused into one, not subject either to
the other, but the Romans labouring at the arts of peace, the Goths
wielding for their defence the sword of war. Over all was to be the
strong hand of the King of Goths and Romans, repressing the violence
of the one nation, correcting the chicanery of the other, and from one
and all exacting the strict observance of that which was the object of
his daily and nightly cares, <span class="smcap">civilitas</span>. Of this civilitas&#8212;which we
may sometimes translate 'good order,' sometimes 'civilisation,'
sometimes 'the character of a law-abiding citizen,' but which no
English word or phrase fully expresses&#8212;the reader of the following
letters will hear, even to weariness. But though we may be tired of
the phrase, we ought none the less to remember that the thing was that
which Italy stood most in need of, that it was secured for her during
forty years by the labours of Theodoric and Cassiodorus, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> that
happiness, such as she knew not again for many centuries, was the
result.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foresight of Cassiodorus in aiding this policy.</div>

<p>But the theory of a warrior caste of Goths and a trading and labouring
caste of Romans was not flattering to the national vanity of a people
who, though they had lost all relish for fighting, could not forget
the great deeds of their forefathers. This was no doubt the weak point
of the new State-system, though one cannot say that it is a weakness
which need have been fatal if time enough had been given for the
working out of the great experiment, and for Roman and Goth to become
in Italy, as they did become in Spain, one people. The grounds upon
which the praise of far-seeing statesmanship may be claimed for
Cassiodorus are, that notwithstanding the bitter taste which it must
have had in his mouth, as in the mouth of every educated Roman, he
perceived that here was the best medicine for the ills of Italy. All
attempts to conjure with the great name of the Roman Empire could only
end in subjection to the really alien rule of Byzantium. All attempts
to rouse the religious passions of the Catholic against the heretical
intruders were likely to benefit the Catholic but savage Frank. The
cruel sufferings of the Italians at the hands of the Heruli of
Belisarius and from the ravages of the Alamannic Brethren are
sufficient justification of the soundness of Cassiodorus' view that
Theodoric's State-system was the one point of hope for Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His religious tolerance.</div>

<p>Allusion has been made in the last paragraph to the religious
differences which divided the Goths from the Italians. It is well
known that Theodoric was an Arian, but an Arian of the most tolerant
type, quite unlike the bitter persecutors who reigned at Toulouse and
at Carthage. During the last few years of his reign, indeed, when his
mind was perhaps in some degree failing, he was tempted by the
persecuting policy of the Emperor Justin into retaliatory measures of
persecution towards his Catholic subjects, but as a rule his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> policy
was eminently fair and even-handed towards the professors of the two
hostile creeds, and even towards the generally proscribed nation of
the Jews. So conspicuous to all the world was his desire to hold the
balance perfectly even between the two communions, that it was said of
him that he beheaded an orthodox deacon who was singularly dear to
him, because he had professed the Arian faith in order to win his
favour. But this story, though told by a nearly contemporary
writer<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, is, it may be hoped, mere Saga.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This did not proceed from indifference.</div>

<p>The point which we may note is, that this policy of toleration or
rather of absolute fairness between warring creeds, though not
initiated by Cassiodorus, seems to have thoroughly commended itself to
his reason and conscience. It is from his pen that we get those golden
words which may well atone for many platitudes and some ill-judged
display of learning: <i>Religionem imperare non possumus, quia nemo
cogitur ut credat invitus</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. And this tolerant temper of mind is
the more to be commended, because it did not proceed from any
indifference on his part to the subjects of religious controversy.
Cassiodorus was evidently a devout and loyal Catholic. Much the larger
part of his writings is of a theological character, and the
thirty-five years of his life which he passed in a monastery were
evidently</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>with the earlier years passed at Court and in the Council-chamber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Date of the commencement of the Variae.</div>

<p>We cannot trace as we should like to do the precise limits of time by
which the official career of Cassiodorus was bounded. The 'Various
Letters' are evidently not arranged in strict chronological order, and
to but few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> of them is it possible to affix an exact date. There are
two or three, however, which require especial notice, because some
authors have assigned them to a date previous to that at which, as I
believe, the author entered the service of the Emperor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to Anastasius.</div>

<p>The first letter of the whole series is addressed to the Emperor
Anastasius. It has been sometimes connected with the embassy of
Faustus in 493, or with that of Festus in 497, to the Court of
Constantinople, the latter of which embassies resulted in the
transmission to Theodoric of 'the ornaments of the palace' (that is
probably the regal insignia) which Odovacar had surrendered to Zeno.
But the language of the letter in question, which speaks of 'causas
iracundiae,' does not harmonise well with either of these dates, since
there was then, as far as we know, no quarrel between Ravenna and
Constantinople. On the other hand, it would fit perfectly with the
state of feeling between the two Courts in 505, after Sabinian the
general of Anastasius had been defeated by the troops of Theodoric
under Pitzias at the battle of Horrea Margi; or in 508, when the
Byzantine ships had made a raid on Apulia and plundered Tarentum. To
one of these dates it should probably be referred, its place at the
beginning of the collection being due to the exalted rank of the
receiver of the letter, not to considerations of chronology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letters to Clovis.</div>

<p>The <a href="#ii40">fortieth</a> and <a href="#ii40">forty-first</a> letters of the
<a href="#BOOK_II">Second Book</a> relate to the
sending of a harper to Clovis, or, as Cassiodorus calls him, Luduin,
King of the Franks. In the earlier letter Boethius is directed to
procure such a harper (citharoedus), and to see that he is a
first-rate performer. In the later, Theodoric congratulates his royal
brother-in-law on his victory over the Alamanni, adjures him not to
pursue the panic-stricken fugitives who have taken refuge within the
Ostrogothic territory, and sends ambassadors to introduce the harper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
whom Boethius has provided. It used to be thought that these letters
must be referred to 496, the year of the celebrated victory of Clovis
over the Alamanni, commonly, but incorrectly, called the battle of
Tulbiacum. But this was a most improbable theory, for it was difficult
to understand how a boy of sixteen (and that was the age of Boethius
in 496) should have attained such eminence as a musical connoisseur as
to be entrusted with the task of selecting the citharoedus. And in a
very recent monograph<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Herr von Schubert has shown, I think
convincingly, that the last victory of Clovis over the Alamanni, and
their migration to Raetia within the borders of Theodoric's territory,
occurred not in 496 but a few years later, probably about 503 or 504.
It is true that Gregory of Tours (to whom the earlier battle is
all-important, as being the event which brought about the conversion
of Clovis) says nothing about this later campaign; but to those who
know the fragmentary and incomplete character of this part of his
history, such an omission will not appear an important argument.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letters to Gaulish princes.</div>

<p>The letters written in Theodoric's name to Clovis, to Alaric II, to
Gundobad of Burgundy, and to other princes, in order to prevent the
outbreak of a war between the Visigoths and the Franks, have been by
some authors<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> assigned to a date some years before the war actually
broke out; but though this cannot, perhaps, be disproved, it seems to
me much more probable that they were written in the early part of 507
on the eve of the war between Clovis and Alaric, which they were
powerless to avert.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duration of Cassiodorus' office.</div>

<p>More difficult than the question of the beginning of the Quaestorship
of Cassiodorus is that of its duration and its close. It was an office
which was in its nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> an annual one. At the commencement of each
fresh year 'of the Indiction,' that is on the first of September of
the calendar year, a Quaestor was appointed; but there does not seem
to have been anything to prevent the previous holder of the office
from being re-appointed. In the case of Cassiodorus, the Quaestor
after Theodoric's own heart, his intimate friend and counsellor, this
may have been done for several years running, or he may have
apparently retired from office for a year and then resumed it. It is
clear, that whether in or out of office he had always, as the King's
friend, a large share in the direction of State affairs. He himself
says, in a letter supposed to be addressed to himself after the death
of Theodoric<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>: 'Non enim proprios fines sub te <i>ulla dignitas</i>
custodivit;' and that this was the fact we cannot doubt. Whatever his
nominal dignity might be, or if for the moment he possessed no
ostensible office at all, he was still virtually what we should call
the Prime Minister of the Ostrogothic King<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consulship of Cassiodorus, 514.</div>

<p>In the year 514 he received an honour which, notwithstanding that it
was utterly divorced from all real authority, was still one of the
highest objects of the ambition of every Roman noble: he was hailed as
Consul Ordinarius, and gave his name to the year. For some reason
which is not stated, possibly because the City of Constantinople was
in that year menaced by the insurrection of Vitalian, no colleague in
the East was nominated to share his dignity; and the entry in the
Consular Calendars is therefore 'Senatore solo Consule.'</p>

<p>In his own Chronicle, Cassiodorus adds the words,'Me etiam Consule in
vestrorum laude temporum, adunato clero vel [= et] populo, Romanae
Ecclesiae rediit optata<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> concordia.' This sentence no doubt relates to
the dissensions which had agitated the Roman Church ever since the
contested Papal election of Symmachus and Laurentius in the year 498.
Victory had been assured to Symmachus by the Synod of 501, but
evidently the feelings of hatred then aroused had still smouldered on,
especially perhaps among the Senators and high nobles of Rome, who had
for the most part adopted the candidature of Laurentius. Now, on the
death of Symmachus (July 18, 514) the last embers of the controversy
were extinguished, and the genial influence of Cassiodorus, Senator by
name and Consul by office, was successfully exerted to induce nobles,
clergy, and people to unite in electing a new Pope. After eight days
Hormisdas the Campanian sat in the Chair of St. Peter, an undoubted
Pontiff.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deference to the Roman Senate.</div>

<p>Not only in maintaining the dignity of the Consulship, but also in
treating the Roman Senate with every outward show of deference and
respect, did the Ostrogothic King follow and even improve upon the
example of the Roman Emperors. The student of the following letters
will observe the tone of deep respect which is almost always adopted
towards the Senate; how every nomination of importance to an official
post is communicated to them, almost as if their suffrages were
solicited for the new candidate; what a show is made of consulting
them in reference to peace and war; and what a reality there seems to
be in the appeals made to their loyalty to the new King after the
death of Theodoric. In all this, as in the whole relation of the
Empire to the Senate during the five centuries of their joint
existence, it is difficult to say where well-acted courtesy ended, and
where the desire to secure such legal power as yet remained to a
venerable assembly began. Perhaps when we remember that for many
glorious centuries the Senate had been the real ruler of the Roman
State, we may assert that the attitude and the language of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> the
successors of Augustus towards the Conscript Fathers were similar to
those used by a modern House of Commons towards the Crown, only that
in the one case the individual supplanted the assembly, in the other
the assembly supplanted the individual. But whatever the exact
relations between King and Senate may have been, and though
occasionally the former found it necessary to rebuke the latter pretty
sharply for conduct unbecoming their high position, there can be no
doubt that the general intention of Theodoric was to soothe the
wounded pride and flatter the vanity of the Roman Senators by every
means in his power: and for this purpose no one could be so well
fitted as Cassiodorus, Senator by name and by office, descendant of
many generations of Roman nobles, and master of such exuberant
rhetoric that it was difficult then, as it is often impossible now, to
extract any definite meaning from his sonorous periods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cassiodorus Patrician.</div>

<p>It was possibly upon his laying down the Consulship, that Cassiodorus
received the dignity of Patrician&#8212;a dignity only, for in itself it
seems to have conferred neither wealth nor power. Yet a title which
had been borne by Ricimer, Odovacar, and Theodoric himself might well
excite the ambition of Theodoric's subject. If our conjecture be
correct that it was conferred upon Cassiodorus in the year 515, he
received it at an earlier age than his father, to whom only about ten
or eleven years before he had written the letter announcing his
elevation to this high dignity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chronicon.</div>

<p>Five years after his Consulate, Cassiodorus undertook a little piece
of literary labour which he does not appear to have held in high
account himself (since he does not include it in the list of his
works), and which has certainly added but little to his fame. This was
his 'Chronicon,' containing an abstract of the history of the world
from the deluge down to <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 519, the year of the Consulship of the
Emperor Justin, and of Theo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>doric's son-in-law Eutharic. This
Chronicle is for the most part founded upon, or rather copied from,
the well-known works of Eusebius and Prosper, the copying being
unfortunately not correctly done. More than this, Cassiodorus has
attempted with little judgment to combine the mode of reckoning by
Consular years and by years of Emperors. As he is generally two or
three years out in his reckoning of the former, this proceeding has
the curious result of persistently throwing some Consulships of the
reigning Emperor into the reign of his predecessor.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Thus Probus is
Consul for two years under Aurelian, and for one year under Tacitus;
both the two Consulships of Carus and the first of Diocletian are
under Probus, while Diocletian's second Consulship is under Carinus
and Numerianus; and so forth. It is wonderful that so intelligent a
person as Cassiodorus did not see that combinations of this kind were
false upon the face of them.</p>

<p>When the Chronicle gets nearer to the compiler's own times it becomes
slightly more interesting, but also slightly less fair. Throughout the
fourth century a few little remarks are interspersed in the dry list
of names and dates, the general tendency of which is to praise up the
Gothic nation or to extenuate their faults and reverses. The battle of
Pollentia (402<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>) is unhesitatingly claimed as a Gothic victory; the
clemency of Alaric at the capture of Rome (410) is magnified; the
valour of the Goths is made the cause of the defeat of Attila in the
Catalaunian plains (451); the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> Gothic Eutharic is put before
that of Byzantine Justin in the consular list; and so forth. Upon the
whole, as has been already said, the work cannot be considered as
adding to the reputation of its author; nor can it be defended from
the terrible attack which has been made upon it by that scholar of our
own day whose opinion upon such a subject stands the highest, Theodor
Mommsen<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. Only, when he makes this unfortunate Chronicle reflect
suspicion on the other works of Cassiodorus, and especially on the
Gothic History<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, the German scholar seems to me to chastise the
busy Minister more harshly than he deserves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Gothic History.</div>

<p>I have just alluded to the Gothic History of Cassiodorus. It was
apparently shortly after the composition of his Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> that
this, in some respects his most important work, was compiled and
arranged according to his accustomed habit in twelve books. His own
estimate&#8212;and it is not a low one&#8212;of the value of this performance is
expressed in a letter which he makes his young Sovereign Athalaric
address to the Senate on his promotion to the Praefecture<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>: 'He
extended his labours even to our remote ancestry, learning by his
reading that which scarcely the hoar memories of our forefathers
retained. He drew forth from their hiding-place the Kings of the
Goths, hidden by long forgetfulness. He restored the Amals to their
proper place with the lustre of his own<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> lineage (?), evidently
proving that up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> to the seventeenth generation we have had kings for
our ancestors. He made the origin of the Goths a part of Roman
history, collecting as it were into one wreath all the flowery growth
which had before been scattered through the plains of many books.
Consider therefore what love he showed to you [the Senate] in praising
us, he who showed that the nation of your Sovereign had been from
antiquity a marvellous people; so that ye, who from the days of your
forefathers have ever been deemed noble, are yet ruled over by the
ancient progeny of Kings<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its purpose.</div>

<p>In reading this estimate by Cassiodorus of his own performance, we can
see at once that it lacked that first of all conditions precedent for
the attainment of absolute historic truth, complete impartiality<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.
Like Hume and like Macaulay Cassiodorus wrote his history with a
purpose. We may describe that purpose as two-fold:</p>

<p>(1) To vindicate the claim of the Goths to rank among the historic
nations of antiquity by bringing them into some sort of connection
with Greece and Rome ('Originem Gothicam historiam fecit esse
Romanam'); and (2) among the Goths, to exalt as highly as possible the
family of the Amals, that family from which Theodoric had sprung, and
to string as many regal names as possible upon the Amal chain
('Evidenter ostendens in decimam septimam progeniem stirpem nos habere
regalem').</p>

<p>I have said that the possession of a purpose like this is unfavourable
to the attainment of absolute historic truth; but the aim which
Cassiodorus proposed to himself was a lofty one, being in fact the
reconciliation of the past and the future of the world by showing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the outworn Latin race that the new blood which was being poured into
it by the northern nations came, like its own, from a noble ancestry:
and, for us, the labour to which it stimulated him has been full of
profit, since to it we owe something like one half of our knowledge of
the Teutonic ancestors of Modern Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confusion between Goths and Getae.</div>

<p>The much-desired object of 'making the origin of Gothic history Roman'
was effected chiefly by attributing to the Goths all that Cassiodorus
found written in classic authors concerning the Getae or the
Scythians. The confusion between Goths and Getae, though modern
ethnologists are nearly unanimous in pronouncing it to be a confusion
between two utterly different nations, is not one for which
Cassiodorus is responsible, since it had been made at least a hundred
years before his time. When the Emperor Claudius II won his great
victories over the Goths in the middle of the Third Century, he was
hailed rightly enough by the surname of <i>Gothicus</i>; but when at the
beginning of the Fifth Century the feeble Emperors Arcadius and
Honorius wished to celebrate a victory which, as they vainly hoped,
had effectually broken the power of the Goths, the words which they
inscribed upon the Arch of Triumph were 'Quod <i>Getarum</i> nationem in
omne aevum docuere extingui.' In the poems of Claudian, and generally
in all the contemporary literature of the time, the regular word for
the countrymen of Alaric is Getae.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The term Scythian.</div>

<p>The Greek historians, on the other hand, freely applied the general
term Scythian&#8212;as they had done at any time since the Scythian
campaign of Darius Hystaspis&#8212;to any barbarian nation living beyond
the Danube and the Cimmerian Bosporus. With these two clues, or
imaginary clues, in his hand, Cassiodorus could traverse a
considerable part of the border-land of classical antiquity. The
battles between the Scythians and the Egyptians, the story of the
Amazons, Telephus son of Hercules and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> nephew of Priam, the defeat of
Cyrus by Tomyris, and the unsuccessful expedition of Darius&#8212;all were
connected with Gothic history by means of that easily stretched word,
Scythia. Then comes Sitalces, King of Thrace, who makes war on
Perdiccas of Macedon; and then, 'in the time of Sylla,' a certain wise
philosopher-king of Dacia, Diceneus by name, in whose character and
history Cassiodorus perhaps outlined his own ideal of wisdom swaying
brute force. With these and similar stories culled from classical
authors Cassiodorus appears to have filled up the interval&#8212;which was
to him of absolutely uncertain duration&#8212;between the Gothic migration
from the Baltic to the Euxine and their appearance as conquerors and
ravagers in the eastern half of the Roman Empire in the middle of the
third century of the Christian era. Now, soothing as it may have been
to the pride of a Roman subject of Theodoric to be informed that his
master's ancestors had fought at the war of Troy and humbled the pride
of Perdiccas, to a scientific historian these Scytho-Getic histories
culled from Herodotus and Trogus are of little or no value, and his
first step in the process of enquiry is to eliminate them from
'Gothica historia,' thus making it, as far as he can, <i>not</i> 'Romana.'
The question then arises whether there was another truly Gothic
element in the history of Cassiodorus, and if so, what value can be
attached to it. Thus enquiring we soon find, both before and after
this intrusive Scytho-Getic element, matter of quite a different kind,
which has often much of the ring of the true Teutonic <i>Saga</i>. It is
reasonable to believe that here Cassiodorus, whose mission it was to
reconcile Roman and Goth, and who could not have achieved this end by
altering the history of the less civilised people out of all
possibility of recognition by its own chieftains and warriors, has
really interwoven in his work some part of the songs and Sagas which
were still current among the older men who had shared the wanderings
of Theodoric. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> legendary portion, which Cassiodorus himself
perhaps half despised, as being gathered not from books but from the
lips of rude minstrels, is in fact the only part of his work which has
any scientific value.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amal pedigree.</div>

<p>In his glorification of the Amal line, Cassiodorus follows more
closely these genuine national traditions than in his history of the
Gothic people. References to Herodotus and Trogus would have been here
obviously out of place, and he accordingly puts before us a pedigree
fashioned on the same model as those which we find in the Saxon
Chronicle, and therefore probably genuine. By genuine of course is
meant a pedigree which was really current and accepted among the
people over whom Theodoric ruled. How many of the links which form it
represent real historical personages is a matter about which we may
almost be said neither to know nor care. We see that it begins in the
approved fashion with 'Non puri homines sed semidei id est Anses<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>,'
and that the first of these half-divine ancestors is named <i>Gaut</i>,
evidently the eponymous hero of the Gothic people. Some of the later
links&#8212;Amal, Ostrogotha, Athal&#8212;have the same appearance of names
coined to embody facts of the national consciousness. At the end of
the genealogy appear the undoubtedly historical names of the immediate
ancestors of Theodoric. It is noteworthy that several, in fact the
majority of the names of Kings who figure in early Gothic history, are
not included in this genealogy. While this fact permits us to doubt
whether Cassiodorus has not exaggerated the pre-eminence of the Amal
race in early days, it must be admitted to be also an evidence of the
good faith with which he preserved the national tradition on these
points. Had he been merely inventing, it would have been easy to
include every name of a distinguished Gothic King among the
progenitors of his Sovereign.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Abstract by Jordanes.</div>

<p>Such then was the general purpose of the Gothic History of
Cassiodorus. The book itself has perished&#8212;a tantalising loss when we
consider how many treatises from the same pen have been preserved to
us which we could well have spared. But we can speak, as will be seen
from the preceding remarks, with considerable confidence as to its
plan and purpose, because we possess in the well-known treatise of
Jordanes 'On the Origin of the Goths<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>' an abbreviated copy,
executed it is true by a very inferior hand, but still manifestly
preserving some of the features of the original. It will not be
necessary here to go into the difficult question as to the personality
of this writer, which has been debated at considerable length and with
much ingenuity by several German authors<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. It is enough to say that
Jordanes, who was, according to his own statement, 'agrammatus,' a man
of Gothic descent, a notary, and then a monk<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, on the alleged
request of his friend Castalius, 'compressed the twelve books of
Senator, <i>de origine actibusque Getarum</i>, bringing down the history
from olden times to our own days by kings and generations, into one
little pamphlet.' Still, according to his statement, which there can
be little doubt is here thoroughly false, he had the loan of the
Gothic History for only three days from the steward of Cassiodorus,
and wrote chiefly or entirely from his recollection of this hasty
perusal<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. He says that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> added some suitable passages from the
Greek and Latin historians, but his own range of historical reading
was evidently so narrow that we may fairly suspect these additions to
have been of the slenderest possible dimensions. Upon the whole, there
can be little doubt that it is a safe rule to attribute everything
that is good or passable in this little treatise to Cassiodorus, and
everything that is very bad, childish, and absurd in it to Jordanes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Temporary retirement from official life (?).</div>

<p>The literary labours of Cassiodorus, of which the Gothic History was
one of the fruits, were probably continued for two or three years
after its completion<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. At least there is reason to believe that he
was not actively engaged in the service of the State during those
terrible years (524 and 525) in which the failing intellect of
Theodoric, goaded almost to madness by Justin's persecution of his
Arian co-religionists, condescended to ignoble measures of
retaliation, which brought him into collision with Senate and Pope,
and in the end tarnished his fame by the judicial murder of Boethius
and Symmachus. It was fortunate indeed for Cassiodorus if he was
during this time, perhaps because of his unwillingness to help the
King to his own hurt, enjoying an interval of literary retirement at
Squillace. His honour must have suffered if he had abetted the
intolerant policy of Theodoric; his life might have been forfeit if he
had openly opposed it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cassiodorus as Master of the Offices, 526.</div>

<p>Whatever may have been the cause of the temporary obscuration of
Cassiodorus, he was soon again shining in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> all the splendour of
official dignity; for when Theodoric died, his old and trusted
minister was holding&#8212;probably not for the first time in his official
career<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>&#8212;the great place of Master of the Offices.</p>

<p>The <i>Magister Officiorum</i>, whose relation to the other members of the
Cabinet of the Sovereign was somewhat indefinite, and who was in fact
constantly trying to enlarge the circle of his authority at their
expense, was at the head of the Civil Service of the Roman Empire, and
afterwards occupied a similar position in the Ostrogothic State. It
was said of him by the Byzantine orator Priscus (himself a man who had
been engaged in important embassies), 'Of all the counsels of the
Emperor the Magister is a partaker, inasmuch as the messengers and
interpreters and the soldiers employed on guard at the palace are
ranged under him.' Quite in harmony with this general statement are
the more precise indications of the 'Notitia.' There, 'under the
disposition of the illustrious Magister Officiorum,' we find five
<i>Scholae</i>, which seem to have been composed of household troops<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.
Then comes the great Schola of the <i>Agentes in rebus</i> and their
deputies&#8212;a mighty army of 'king's messengers,' who swarmed through
all the Provinces of the Empire, executing the orders of the
Sovereign, and earning gold and hatred from the helpless Provincials
among whom their errands lay. In addition to these the four great
stationary bureaux&#8212;the Scrinium Memoriae, Scrinium Dispositionum,
Scrinium Epistolarum, and Scrinium Libellorum&#8212;the offices whose duty
it was to conduct the correspondence of the Sovereign with foreign
powers, and to answer the petitions of his own subjects, all owned the
Master of the Offices as their head. More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>over, the great arsenals (of
which there were six in Italy at Concordia, Verona, Mantua, Cremona,
Ticinum, and Lucca) received their orders from the same official. An
anomalous and too widely dispersed range of functions this seems
according to our ideas, including something of the Secretaryship for
Foreign Affairs, something of the Home Secretaryship, and something of
the War Office and the Horse Guards. Yet, as if this were not enough,
there was also transferred to him from the office of the Praetorian
Praefect the superintendence of the Cursus Publicus, that excellent
institution by which facilities for intercourse were provided between
the capital and the most distant Provinces, relays of post-horses
being kept at every town, available for use by those who bore properly
signed 'letters of evection.' Thus to the multifarious duties of the
Master of the Offices was added in effect the duty of
Postmaster-General. It was found however in practice to be an
inconvenient arrangement for the Master of the Offices to have the
control of the services of the 'public horses,' while the Praetorian
Praefect remained responsible for the supply of their food; and the
charge of the <i>Cursus Publicus</i> was accordingly retransferred&#8212;at any
rate in the Eastern Empire&#8212;to the office of the Praefect, though the
letters of evection still required the counter-signature of the
Master<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Theodoric, Aug. 30, 526.</div>

<p>Such was the position of Cassiodorus when, on the 30th of August, 526,
by the death of Theodoric, he lost the master whom he had served so
long and so faithfully. The difficulties which beset the new reign are
pretty clearly indicated in the letters which Cassiodorus published in
the name of the young King Athalaric, Theodoric's grandson, and which
are to be found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<a href="#BOOK_VIII">Eighth Book</a> of the 'Variae.' Athalaric himself
being only a boy of eight or ten years of age, supreme power was
vested in his mother Amalasuentha, with what title we are unable to
say, but apparently not with that of Queen. This Princess, a woman of
great and varied accomplishments, perhaps once a pupil, certainly a
friend, of Cassiodorus, ruled entirely in accordance with the maxims
of his statesmanship, and endeavoured with female impulsiveness to
carry into effect his darling scheme of Romanising the Goths. During
the whole of her regency we may doubtless consider Cassiodorus as
virtually her Prime Minister, and the eight years which it occupied
were without doubt that portion of his life in which he exercised the
most direct and unquestioned influence on State affairs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Services of Cassiodorus to the Regent Amalasuentha.</div>

<p>His services at the commencement of the new reign will be best
described in his own words: 'Nostris quoque principiis<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>' (the
letter is written in Athalaric's name) 'quanto se labore concessit,
cum novitas regni multa posceret ordinari? Erat solus ad universa
sufficiens. Ipsum dictatio publica, ipsum consilia nostra poscebant;
et labore ejus actum est ne laboraret imperium. <i>Reperimus eum quidem
Magistrum sed implevit nobis Quaestoris officium</i>: et mercedes
justissima devotione persolvens, cautelam, quam ab auctore nostro
didicerat, libenter haeredis utilitatibus exhibebat<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fears of invasion.</div>

<p>Cassiodorus then goes on to describe how he laboured for his young
Sovereign with the sword as well as with the pen. Some hostile
invasion was dreaded, perhaps from the Franks, or, more probably, from
the Vandals, whose relations with the Ostrogoths at that time were
strained, owing to the murder of Theodoric's sister Amalafrida by
Hilderic the Vandal King. Cassiodorus provided ships and equipped
soldiers at his own expense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> probably for the defence of his beloved
Province of Bruttii. The alarm of war passed away, but difficulties
appear to have arisen owing to the sudden cancellation of the
contracts which had been entered into when hostilities seemed
imminent; and to these difficulties Cassiodorus tells us that he
brought his trained experience as an administrator and a judge,
resolving them so as to give satisfaction to all who were concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cassiodorus as Praetorian Praefect, 533.</div>

<p>Seven years of Amalasuentha's regency thus passed, and now at length,
at fifty-three years of age, Cassiodorus was promoted (Sept. 1, 533)
to the most distinguished place which a subject could occupy. He
received from Amalasuentha the office of Praetorian Praefect. As
thirty-three years had elapsed since his father was invested with the
same dignity, we may fairly conjecture that father and son both
climbed this eminence at the same period of their lives; yet,
considering the extraordinary credit which the younger Cassiodorus
enjoyed at Court, we might have expected that he would have been
clothed with the Praefecture before he attained the fifty-third year
of his age. And, in fact, he hints in the letter composed by him, in
which he informs himself of his own elevation<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, that that elevation
had been somewhat too long delayed, though the reason which he alleges
for the delay (namely, that the people might greet the new Praefect
the more heartily<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>) is upon the face of it not the true cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Office of the Praetorian Praefect.</div>

<p>The majesty of the Praetorian Praefect's office is fully dwelt upon
and its functions described in a letter in the following
collection<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, to which the reader is referred. Originally only the
chief officer of those Praetorian troops in Rome by whom the Emperor
was guarded, until, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> was so often the case, he was in some fit of
petulance by the same pampered sentinels dethroned, the Praefectus
Praetorio had gradually become more and more of a judge, less and less
of a soldier. In the great changes wrought by Constantine the
Praetorian guards disappeared&#8212;somewhat in the same fashion after
which the Janissaries were removed by Sultan Mahmoud. The Praetorian
Praefect's dignity, however, survived, and though he lost every shred
of military command he became or continued to be the first civil
servant of the Empire. Cassiodorus is fond of comparing him to Joseph
at the Court of Pharaoh, nor is the comparison an inapt one. In the
Constantinople of our own day the Grand Vizier holds a position not
altogether unlike that which the Praefect held in the Court of
Arcadius and Theodosius. 'The office of this Praefect,' said one who
had spent his life as one of his subordinates<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>,' is like the Ocean,
encircling all other offices and ministering to all their needs. The
Consulate is indeed higher in rank than the Praefecture, but less in
power. The Praefect wears a <i>mandye</i>, or woollen cloak, dyed with the
purple of Cos, and differing from the Emperor's only in the fact that
it reaches not to the feet but to the knees. Girt with his sword he
takes his seat as President of the Senate. When that body has
assembled, the chiefs of the army fall prostrate before the Praefect,
who raises them and kisses each in turn, in order to express his
desire to be on good terms with the military power. Nay, even the
Emperor himself walks (or till lately used to walk) on foot from his
palace to meet the Praefect as he moves slowly towards him at the head
of the Senate. The insignia of the Praefect's office are his lofty
chariot, his golden reed-case [pen-holder], weighing one hundred
pounds, his massive silver inkstand, and silver bowl on a tripod of
the same metal to receive the petitions of suitors. Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> official
yachts wait upon his orders, and convey him from the capital to the
neighbouring Provinces.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Praetorian Praefect as Judge of Appeal.</div>

<p>The personage thus highly placed had a share in the government of the
State, a share which the Master of the Offices was for ever trying to
diminish, but which, in the hands of one who like Cassiodorus was
<i>persona grata</i> at the Court, might be made not only important but
predominant<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. The chief employment, however, of the ordinary
Praefectus Praetorio consisted in hearing appeals from the Governors
of the Provinces. When the magical words 'Provoco ad Caesarem' had
been uttered, it was in most cases before the Praetorian Praefect that
the appeal was practically heard; and when the Praetorian Praefect had
pronounced his decision, no appeal from that was permitted, even to
the Emperor himself<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letters written during the Praefecture of Cassiodorus.</div>

<p>Cassiodorus held the post of Praetorian Praefect, amid various changes
in the fortunes of the State, from 533 to 538, or perhaps a year or
two longer. Of his activity in the domain of internal administration,
the <a href="#BOOK_XI">Eleventh</a> and <a href="#BOOK_XII">Twelfth</a> Books of the 'Variae' give a vivid and
interesting picture. Unfortunately, neither those books nor the
<a href="#BOOK_X">Tenth
Book</a> of the same collection, which contains the letters written by him
during the same time in the names of the successive Gothic Sovereigns,
give any sufficient information as to the real course of public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
events. Great misfortunes, great crimes, and the movements of great
armies are covered over in these documents by a veil of unmeaning
platitudes and hypocritical compliments. In order to enable the
student to 'read between the lines,' and to pierce through the
verbiage of these letters to the facts which they were meant to hint
at or to conceal, it will be necessary briefly to describe the
political history of the period as we learn it from the narratives of
Procopius and Jordanes&#8212;narratives which may be inaccurate in a few
minor details but are doubtless correct in their main outlines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition to Romanising policy of Amalasuentha.</div>

<p>The Romanising policy of the cultivated but somewhat self-willed
Princess Amalasuentha met with considerable opposition on the part of
her Gothic subjects. Above all, they objected to the bookish education
which she was giving to her son, the young King. They declared that it
was entirely contrary to the maxims of Theodoric that a young Goth
should be trembling before the strap of a pedagogue when he ought to
be learning to look unfalteringly on spear and sword. These
representations were so vigorously made, and by speakers of such high
rank in the State, that Amalasuentha was compelled to listen to them,
to remove her son from the society of his teachers, and to allow him
to associate with companions of his own age, who, not being wisely
chosen, soon initiated him in every kind of vice and dissipation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amalasuentha puts three Gothic nobles to death.</div>

<p>The Princess, who had not forgiven the leaders of the Gothic party for
their presumptuously offered counsels, singled out three of the most
powerful nobles who were at the head of that party and sent them into
honourable banishment at the opposite ends of Italy. Finding, however,
that they were still holding communication with one another, she sent
to the Emperor Justinian to ask if he would give her an asylum in his
dominions if she required it, and then gave orders for the secret
assassination of the three noblemen. The <i>coup d'&#233;tat</i> succeeded: she
had no need to flee the country; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> ship bearing the royal
treasure, which amounted to 40,000 pounds weight of gold, which she
had sent to Dyrrhachium to await her possible flight, was ordered to
return home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Embassies between Ravenna and Constantinople.</div>

<p>Athalaric's health was now rapidly failing, owing to his licentious
excesses, and Amalasuentha, fearing that after his death her own life
might be in danger, began again secretly to negotiate with Justinian
for the entire surrender of the kingdom of Italy into his hands, on
receiving an assurance of shelter and maintenance at the Court of
Byzantium. These negotiations were masked by others of a more public
kind, in which Justinian claimed the Sicilian fortress of Lilybaeum,
which had once belonged to the Vandals; insisted on the surrender of
some Huns, deserters from the army of Africa; and demanded redress for
the sack by the Goths of the Moesian city of Gratiana. These claims
Amalasuentha met publicly with a reply as brave and uncompromising as
her most patriotic subjects could desire, but in private, as has been
already said, she was prepared, for an adequate assurance of personal
safety, to barter away all the rights and liberties of her Italian
subjects, Roman as well as Gothic, and to allow her father's
hard-earned kingdom to sink into a mere dependency of Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Athalaric, Oct. 2, 534.</div>

<p>Such was the position of affairs when on the 2nd October 534, little
more than a year after Cassiodorus had donned the purple of the
Praefect, Athalaric died, and by his death the whole attitude of the
parties to the negotiations was changed. The power to rule, and with
it the very power to make terms of any kind with the Emperor, was in
danger of slipping from the hands of Amalasuentha. The principle of
female sovereignty was barely accepted by any Teutonic tribe.
Evidently the Ostrogoths had not accepted it, or Amalasuentha would
have ruled as Queen in her own right instead of as Regent for her son.
In order to strengthen her position, and ensure her acceptance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> as
Sovereign by the Gothic warriors, she decided to associate with
herself, not in matrimony, for he was already married, but in regal
partnership, her cousin Theodahad, the nearest male heir of Theodoric,
and to mount the throne together with him. Previously, however, to
announcing this scheme in public, she sent for Theodahad and exacted
from him 'tremendous oaths<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>' that if he were chosen King he would
be satisfied with the mere name of royalty, leaving her as much of the
actual substance of power as she possessed at that moment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amalasuentha associates Theodahad in the Sovereignty.</div>

<p>The partnership-royalty and the oath of self-abnegation were the
desperate expedients of a woman who knew herself to have mighty
enemies among her subjects, and who felt power slipping from her
grasp. With one side of her character her new partner could
sympathise; for Theodahad, though sprung from the loins of Gothic
warriors, was a man of some literary culture, who preferred poring
over the 'Republic' of Plato to heading a charge of the Gothic
cavalry. But his acquaintance with Latin and Greek literature had done
nothing to ennoble his temper or expand his heart. A cold, hard,
avaricious soul, he had been entirely bent on adding field to field
and removing his neighbour's landmark, until the vast possessions
which he had received from the generosity of Theodoric should embrace
the whole of the great Tuscan plain. It will be seen by referring to
two letters in the following collection<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> that Theodoric himself had
twice employed the pen of Cassiodorus to rebuke the rapacity of his
nephew; and at a more recent date, since the beginning of Athalaric's
illness, Amalasuentha had been compelled by the complaints of her
Tuscan subjects to issue a commission of enquiry, which had found
Theodahad guilty of the various acts of land-robbery which had been
charged against him, and had compelled him to make restitution.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Amalasuentha is deposed and imprisoned by Theodahad, April
30, 535.</div>

<p>The new Queen persuaded herself, and tried to persuade her cousin,
that this ignominious sentence had in some way put the subject of it
straight with the world, and had smoothed his pathway to the throne.
She trusted to his gratitude and his tremendous oaths for her own
undisturbed position at the helm of the State, but she found before
many months of the joint reign had passed that the reed upon which she
was leaning was about to pierce her hand. Only four letters, it will
be seen, of the following collection were written by order of
Amalasuentha after the commencement of the joint reign. Soon Theodahad
felt himself strong enough to hurl from the throne the woman who had
dared to compel him to draw back the boundary of his Tuscan
<i>latifundium.</i> The relations of the three noblemen whom Amalasuentha
had put to death gathered gladly round him, eager to work out the
blood-feud; and by their help he slew many of the strongest supporters
of the Queen, and shut her up in prison in a little lonely island upon
the lake of Vulsinii. This event took place on the 30th of April, 535,
not quite seven months after the death of Athalaric<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Embassy of Peter.</div>

<p>During all these later months there had been a perpetual flux and
reflux of diplomatic communications between Ravenna and
Constantinople. The different stages of the negotiations are marked,
apparently with clearness, by Procopius; but it is not always easy to
harmonise them with the letters published by Cassiodorus, who either
did not write, or shrank from republishing, some of the most important
letters to the Emperor. This remark applies to the missive which was
probably taken by the Senators Liberius and Opilio, who were now sent
by Theodahad to Justinian to apologise for the imprisonment of
Amalasuentha, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> to promise that she should receive no injury.
Meanwhile Peter, a rhetorician and an ex-Consul, was travelling from
Constantinople with a commission the character of which was being
constantly changed by the rapid current of events. He started with
instructions to complete the transaction with Amalasuentha as to the
surrender of Italy, and to buy from Theodahad, who was still a private
individual, his possessions in Tuscany. Soon after his departure he
met the ambassadors, who told him of the death of Athalaric and the
accession of Theodahad. On the shores of the Hadriatic he heard of
Amalasuentha's captivity. He waited for further instructions from his
master, and on his arrival at Ravenna he found that all was over. The
letter which he was to have handed to the deposed Queen, assuring her
of Justinian's protection, was already obsolete. The kinsmen of the
three nobles had been permitted or encouraged by Theodahad to end the
blood-feud bloodily. <span class="sidenote">Death of Amalasuentha.</span>They had repaired to the Lake of Vulsinii and
murdered Amalasuentha in her bath<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. The Byzantine ambassador sought
the presence of the King, boldly denounced his wicked deed, and
declared on the part of his master a war which would be waged without
truce or treaty till Amalasuentha was avenged. Thus began the eighteen
years' war between Justinian and the Ostrogoths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why did Cassiodorus continue in the service of Theodahad?</div>

<p>It might certainly have been expected that a statesman who had been
honoured with the intimate friendship of Theodoric and his daughter,
even if unable to avenge her death, would have refused to serve in the
Cabinet of her murderer. It is accordingly with a feeling of painful
surprise that we find Cassiodorus still holding the Secretary's pen,
and writing letter after letter (they form the majority of the
documents in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
<a href="#BOOK_X">Tenth Book</a> of the 'Variae') in the name of Theodahad
and his wife Gudelina. Dangers no doubt were thickening round his
beloved Italy. He may have thought that whoever wore the Gothic crown,
Duty forbade him to quit the Secretum at Ravenna just when war with
the Empire was becoming every day more imminent. On the other hand,
the Praetorian Praefecture, the object of a life's ambition, was now
his, but had been his only for two years. It was hard to lay aside the
purple <i>mandye</i> while the first gloss was yet upon it; hard to have to
fall back into the ranks of the ordinary senators, and no longer to
receive the reverent salutations of the chiefs of the army when he
entered the hall of meeting. Whether the public good or the private
advantage swayed him most who shall say? There are times when
patriotism calls for the costliest sacrifice which a statesman can
make&#8212;the sacrifice, apparently, of his own honour. The man who has
made such a sacrifice must be content to be misjudged by his
fellow-men. Certainly, to us the one stain upon an otherwise pure
reputation seems to be found in the service, the apparently willing
service, which in the <a href="#BOOK_X">Tenth Book</a> of his letters Cassiodorus renders to
Theodahad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vacillation of Theodahad.</div>

<p>Throughout the latter half of 535, Belisarius in Sicily and Mundus in
Dalmatia were warring for Justinian against Theodahad. The rhetorician
Peter, who had boldly rebuked the Gothic King for the murder of his
benefactress, and had on his master's behalf denounced a truceless war
against him, still lingered at his Court. Theodahad, who during part
of the summer and autumn of 535 seems to have been at Rome, not at
Ravenna, was more than half inclined to resume his old negotiations
with the Emperor, and either to purchase peace by sinking into the
condition of a tributary, or to sell his kingdom outright for a
revenue of &#163;48,000 a year and a high place among the nobles of the
Empire. Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>copius<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> gives us a vivid and detailed narrative of the
manner in which these negotiations were conducted by Theodahad, who
was perpetually wavering between arrogance and timidity; trembling at
the successes of Belisarius, elated by any victory which his generals
might win in Dalmatia; and who at length, upon receiving the tidings
of the defeat and death of Mundus, broke off the negotiations
altogether, and shut up Peter and his colleague Athanasius in prison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Silence of the 'Variae' as to many of the negotiations
between Theodahad and Justinian.</div>

<p>Here again, while not doubting the truth of the narrative of
Procopius, I do not find it possible exactly to fit in the letters
written by Cassiodorus for Theodahad with the various stages of the
negotiation as described by him. Especially the striking letter of the
King to the Emperor&#8212;striking by reason of its very abjectness&#8212;which
is quoted by Procopius in the sixth chapter of his First Book, appears
to be entirely unrepresented in the collection of Cassiodorus.
Evidently all this part of the 'Variae' has been severely edited by
its author, who has expunged all that seemed to reflect too great
discredit on the Sovereign whom he had once served, and has preserved
only some letters written to Justinian and Theodora by Theodahad and
his wife, vaguely praising peace, and beseeching the Imperial pair to
restore it to Italy; letters which, as it seems to me, may be applied
with about equal fitness to any movement of the busy shuttle of
diplomacy backwards and forwards between Ravenna and Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theodahad deposed, Witigis elected, Aug. 536.</div>

<p>The onward march of Belisarius trampled all the combinations of
diplomatists into the dust. In the early part of July, 536, he had
succeeded in capturing the important city of Neapolis, and had begun
to threaten Rome. The Gothic warriors, disgusted at the incapacity of
their King, and probably suspecting his disloyalty to the nation, met
(August, 536) under arms upon the plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> of Regeta<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>, deposed
Theodahad, and elected a veteran named Witigis as his successor.
Witigis at once ordered Theodahad to be put to death, and being
himself of somewhat obscure lineage, endeavoured to strengthen his
title to the crown by marrying Matasuentha, the sister of Athalaric
and the only surviving descendant of Theodoric.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter on the elevation of Witigis.</div>

<p>Whether Cassiodorus had any hand in this revolution&#8212;which was
pre-eminently a Gothic movement&#8212;we cannot tell; but certainly one of
the best specimens of his letters is that written in the name of the
new King<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>, in which he makes Witigis thus speak, 'Universis

reigned from August, 536, to May<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>, 540). One has been already
described. All the other four are concerned with negotiations for
peace with Justinian, and may probably be referred to the early part
of the new reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Share of Cassiodorus in the administration during the war.</div>

<p>It will be seen that the letters written by Cassiodorus for the
Sovereign during the five years following the death of Athalaric are
few and somewhat unsatisfactory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> But, on the other hand, it was just
during these years that he wrote in his own name as Praetorian
Praefect the letters which are comprised in the <a href="#BOOK_XI">Eleventh</a> and
<a href="#BOOK_XII">Twelfth</a>
Books of his collection, and which are in some respects the most
interesting of the whole series. There is a strong probability that he
was not present at the long siege of Rome (March, 537, to March, 538),
nor is it likely that he, an elderly civilian, would take much part in
any of the warlike operations that followed. Upon the whole, it seems
probable that during the greater part of this time Cassiodorus was, to
the best of his power, keeping the civil administration together by
virtue of his own authority as Praetorian Praefect, without that
constant reference to the wishes of the Sovereign which would have
been necessary under Theodoric and his daughter. Perhaps, in the
transitional state of things which then prevailed in Italy, with the
power of the Gothic sceptre broken but the sway of the Roman Caesar
not yet firmly established in its stead, men of all parties and both
nationalities were willing that as much as possible of the routine of
government should be carried on by a statesman who was Roman by birth
and culture, but who had been the trusted counsellor of Gothic Kings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dates of later letters.</div>

<p>I have endeavoured as far as possible to fix the dates of these later
letters. It will be seen that we have one<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> probably belonging to
the year 536, five<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> to 537, and one<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> (possibly) to 538. These
later letters refer chiefly to the terrible famine which followed in
the train of the war, and of which Cassiodorus strenuously laboured to
mitigate the severity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">End of Cassiodorus' official career.</div>

<p>It is possible that the Praefect may have continued to hold office
down to the capture of Ravenna in May, 540, which made Witigis a
prisoner, and seemed to bring the Ostrogothic monarchy to an end. Upon
the whole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> however, it is rather more probable that in the year 538
or 539 he finally retired from public life. The dates of his letters
will show that there is nothing in them which forbids us to accept
this conclusion; and the fact, if it be a fact, that in 540, when
Belisarius, with his Secretary Procopius in his train, made his
triumphal entry into Ravenna, the late Praefect was no longer there,
but in his native Province of Bruttii, a little lessens the difficulty
of that which still remains most difficult of comprehension, the
entire omission from Procopius' History of the Gothic War of all
mention of the name of Cassiodorus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Variae edited.</div>

<p>The closing years of the veteran statesman's tenure of office were
years of some literary activity. It was in them that he was
collecting, and to some extent probably revising, the letters which
appear in the following collection. His motives for publishing this
monument of his official life are sufficiently set forth in the two
prefaces, one prefixed to the <a href="#BOOK_I">First Book</a> and the other to the
<a href="#BOOK_XI_P">Eleventh</a>. Much emphasis is laid on the entreaties of his friends, the
regular excuse, in the sixth century as in the nineteenth, for an
author or a politician doing the very thing which most pleases his own
vanity. A worthier reason probably existed in the author's natural
desire to vindicate his own consistency, by showing that the influence
which for more than thirty years he had wielded in the councils of the
Gothic Sovereigns had been uniformly exerted on the side of law and
order and just government, directed equally to the repression of
Teutonic barbarism and the punishment of Roman venality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What alterations were made in the letters.</div>

<p>The question how far the letters which now appear in the 'Variae'
really reproduce the actual documents originally issued by Cassiodorus
is one which has been a good deal discussed by scholars, but with no
very definite result. It is, after all, a matter of conjecture; and
every student who peruses the following letters is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> entitled to form
his own conjecture&#8212;especially as to those marvellous digressions on
matters of Natural History, Moral Philosophy, and the like&#8212;whether
they were veritably included in the original letters that issued from
the Royal Secretum, and were carried over Italy by the Cursus
Publicus. My own conjecture is, that though they may have been a
little amplified and elaborated, substantially they were to be found
in those original documents. The age was pedantic and half-educated,
and had lost both its poetic inspiration and its faculty of humour;
and I fear that these marvellous letters were read by the officials to
whom they were addressed with a kind of stolid admiration, provoking
neither the smile of amusement nor the shrug of impatience which are
their rightful meed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">'Illum atque Illum.'</div>

<p>The reader will observe that in many, in fact most of the letters,
which were meant to serve as credentials to ambassadors or commissions
to civil servants, no names are inserted, but we have instead only the
tantalising formula, 'Illum atque Illum,' which I have generally
translated, 'A and B.' This circumstance has also been much commented
upon, but without our arriving at any very definite result. All that
can be said is, that Cassiodorus must have formed his collection of
State-papers either from rough drafts in his own possession, or from
copies preserved in the public archives, and that, from whichsoever
source he drew, the names in that source had not been preserved: a
striking comment on the rhetorical unbusinesslike character of the
Royal and Imperial Chanceries of that day, in which words were deemed
of more importance than things, and the flowers of speech which were
showered upon the performer of some piece of public business were
preserved, while the name of the performer was forgotten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treatise 'De Anim&#226;.'</div>

<p>As soon as he had finished the collection of the 'Variae,' the
Praefect&#8212;again in obedience to the entreaties of his
friends&#8212;composed a short philosophic treatise on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> Nature of the
Soul ('De Anim&#226;'). As he said, it seems an absurd thing to treat as a
stranger and an unknown quantity the very centre of our being; to seek
to understand the height of the air, the extent of the earth, the
causes of storms and earthquakes, and the nature of the wandering
winds, and yet to leave the faculty, by which we grasp all this
knowledge, itself uncomprehended<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. He therefore sets himself to
enquire, in twelve chapters:</p>

<p>1. Why the Soul is called Anima?</p>

<p>2. What is the definition of the Soul?</p>

<p>3. What is its substantial quality?</p>

<p>4. If it is to be believed to have any shape?</p>

<p>5. What moral virtues it has which contribute to its glory and its
adornment?</p>

<p>6. What are its natural virtues [or powers], given to enable it to
hold together the framework of the body?</p>

<p>7. Concerning the origin of the Soul.</p>

<p>8. What is its especial seat, since it appears to be in a certain
sense diffused over the whole body?</p>

<p>9. Concerning the form and composition of the body itself.</p>

<p>10. Sufficient signs by which we may discern what properties the souls
of sinners possess.</p>

<p>11. Similar signs by which we may distinguish the souls of righteous
men, since we cannot see them with our bodily eyes.</p>

<p>12. Concerning the Soul's state after death, and how it will be
affected by the general resurrection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The treatise ends with a prayer to Christ to preserve the body in good
health, that it may be in tune with the harmony of the soul; to give
reason the ascendancy over the flesh; and to keep the mind in happy
equipoise, neither so strong as to be puffed up with pride, nor so
languid as to fail of its proper powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cassiodorus retires to the cloister.</div>

<p>The line of thought indicated by the 'De Anim&#226;' led, in such a country
as Italy, at such a time as the Gothic War, to one inevitable end&#8212;the
cloister. It can have surprised none of the friends of Cassiodorus
when the veteran statesman announced his intention of spending the
remainder of his days in monastic retirement. He was now sixty years
of age<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>; his wife, if he had ever married, was probably by this
time dead; and we hear nothing of any children for whose sake he need
have remained longer in the world. The Emperor would probably have
received him gladly into his service, but Cassiodorus had now done
with politics. The dream of his life had been to build up an
independent Italian State, strong with the strength of the Goths, and
wise with the wisdom of the Romans. That dream was now scattered to
the winds. Providence had made it plain that not by this bridge was
civilisation to pass over from the Old World to the New. Cassiodorus
accepted the decision, and consecrated his old age to religious
meditation and to a work even more important than any of his political
labours (though one which must be lightly touched on here), the
preservation by the pens of monastic copyists of the Christian
Scriptures, and of the great works of classical antiquity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He founds two monasteries at Scyllacium.</div>

<p>It was to his ancestral Scyllacium that Cassiodorus retired; and here,
between the mountains of Aspromonte and the sea, he founded his
monastery, or, more accurately, his two monasteries, one for the
austere hermit, and the other for the less aspiring coenobite. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
former was situated among the 'sweet recesses of Mons Castellius<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>,'
the latter among the well-watered gardens which took their name from
the Vivaria (fish-ponds) that Cassiodorus had constructed among them
in connection with the river Pellena<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. Baths, too, especially
intended for the use of the sick, had been prepared on the banks of
the stream<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. Here in monastic simplicity, but not without comfort,
Cassiodorus ordained that his monks should dwell. The Rule of the
order&#8212;in so far as it had a written Rule&#8212;was drawn from the writings
of Cassian, the great founder of Western Monachism, who had died about
a century before the Vivarian monastery was founded. In commending the
writings of Cassian to the study of his monks, Cassiodorus warns them
against the bias shown in them towards the Semi-Pelagian heresy, and
desires them to choose the good in those treatises and to refuse the
evil. Whatever the reason may have been, it seems clear that
Cassiodorus did not make the Rule of Benedict the law of his new
monastery; and indeed, strange as the omission may appear, there is, I
believe, no allusion to that great contemporary Saint, the 'Father of
Monks,' in the whole of his writings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Probably never Abbot.</div>

<p>Though the founder and patron of these two monasteries, it seems
probable that Cassiodorus never formally assumed the office of Abbot
in either of them<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. He had probably still some duties to perform as
a large landholder in Bruttii; but besides these he had also work to
do for 'his monks' (as he affectionately called them)&#8212;work of a
literary and educational kind&#8212;which perhaps made it undesirable that
he should be burdened with the petty daily routine of an Abbot's
duties. Some years before, he had endeavoured to induce Pope
Agapetus<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> to found a School of Theology and Christian Literature at
Rome, in imitation of the schools of Alexandria and Nisibis<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. The
clash of arms consequent on the invasion of Italy by Belisarius had
prevented the fulfilment of this scheme; but the aged statesman now
determined to devote the remainder of his days to the accomplishment
of the same purpose in connection with the Vivarian convent.</p>

<p>In the earliest days of Monasticism men like the hermits of the
Thebaid had thought of little else but mortifying the flesh by vigils
and fastings, and withdrawing from all human voices to enjoy an
ecstatic communion with their Maker. The life in common of monks like
those of Nitria and Lerinum had chastened some of the extravagances of
these lonely enthusiasts while still keeping their main ends in view.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
St. Jerome, in his cell at Bethlehem, had shown what great results
might be obtained for the Church of all ages from the patient literary
toil of one religious recluse. And finally St. Benedict, in that Rule
of his which was to be the code of monastic Christendom for centuries,
had sanctified Work as one of the most effectual preservatives of the
bodily and spiritual health of the ascetic, bringing together
<i>Laborare</i> and <i>Orare</i> in friendly union, and proclaiming anew for the
monk as for the untonsured citizen the primal ordinance, 'In the sweat
of thy brow thou shalt eat bread.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">The father of literary Monasticism.</div>

<p>The great merit of Cassiodorus, that which shows his deep insight into
the needs of his age and entitles him to the eternal gratitude of
Europe, was his determination to utilise the vast leisure of the
convent for the preservation of Divine and human learning and for its
transmission to after ages. In the miserable circumstances of the
times Theology was in danger of becoming brutified and ignorant; the
great treasures of Pagan literature were no longer being perpetuated
by the slaves who had once acted as <i>librarii</i> to the Greek or Roman
noble; and with every movement of the Ostrogothic armies, or of the
yet more savage hordes who served under the Imperial standard, with
every sacked city and with every ravaged villa, some Codex, it may be
such as we should now deem priceless and irreplaceable, was perishing.
This being the state of Italy, Cassiodorus resolved to make of his
monastery not merely a place for pious meditation, but a theological
school and a manufactory for the multiplication of copies, not only of
the Scriptures, not only of the Fathers and the commentators on
Scripture, but also of the great writers of pagan antiquity. In the
chapter<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> which he devotes to the description of the <i>scriptorium</i>
of his monastery he describes, with an enthusiasm which must have been
con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>tagious, the noble work done there by the <i>antiquarius</i>: 'He may
fill his mind with the Scriptures while copying the sayings of the
Lord. With his fingers he gives life to men and arms them against the
wiles of the devil. So many wounds does Satan receive as the
<i>antiquarius</i> copies words of Christ. What he writes in his cell will
be scattered far and wide over distant Provinces. Man multiplies the
heavenly words, and by a striking figure&#8212;if I may dare so to
speak&#8212;the three fingers of his hand express the utterances of the
Holy Trinity. The fast-travelling reed writes down the holy words, and
thus avenges the malice of the Wicked One, who caused a reed to be
used to smite the head of the Saviour.'</p>

<p>It is true that the passage here quoted refers only to the work of the
copyist of the Christian Scriptures, but it could easily be shown from
other passages<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> that the literary activity of the monastery was not
confined to these, but was also employed on secular literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bookbinding.</div>

<p>Cassiodorus then goes on to describe the care which he has taken for
the binding of the sacred Codices in covers worthy of the beauty of
their contents, following the example of the householder in the
parable, who provided wedding garments for all who came to the supper
of his son. One pattern volume had been prepared, containing samples
of various sorts of binding, that the amanuensis might choose that
which pleased him best. <span class="sidenote">Mechanical appliances for the convent.</span>He had moreover provided, to help the nightly
toil of the <i>scriptorium</i>, mechanical lamps of some wonderful
construction, which appears to have made them self-trimming, and to
have ensured their having always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> a sufficient supply of oil<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.
Sun-dials also for bright days, and water-clocks for cloudy days and
the night-season, regulated their labour, and admonished them when it
was time to unclose the three fingers, to lay down the reed, and to
assemble with their brethren in the chapel of the convent for psalmody
and prayer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation to the Benedictine Rule.</div>

<p>Upon the whole, though the idea of using the convent as a place of
literary toil and theological training was not absolutely new,
Cassiodorus seems certainly entitled to the praise of having first
realised it systematically and on an extensive scale. It was entirely
in harmony with the spirit of the Rule of St. Benedict, if it was not
formally ordained in that document. At a very early date in the
history of their order, the Benedictines, influenced probably by the
example of the monastery of Vivaria, commenced that long series of
services to the cause of literature which they have never wholly
intermitted. Thus, instead of accepting the obsolete formula for which
some scholars in the last age contended, 'Cassiodorus was a
Benedictine,' we should perhaps be rather justified in maintaining
that Benedict, or at least his immediate followers, were
Cassiodorians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cassiodorus as a transcriber of the Scriptures.</div>

<p>In order to set an example of literary diligence to his monks, and to
be able to sympathise with the difficulties of an amanuensis,
Cassiodorus himself transcribed the Psalter, the Prophets, and the
Epistles<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>, no doubt from the translation of Jerome. This is not the
place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> for enlarging on the merits of Cassiodorus as a custodian and
transmitter of the sacred text. They were no doubt considerable; and
the rules which he gives to his monks, to guide them in the work of
transcription, show that he belonged to the Conservative school of
critics, and was anxious to guard against hasty emendations of the
text, however plausible. Practically, however, his MSS. of the Latin
Scriptures, showing the Itala and the Vulgate in parallel columns,
seem to have been answerable for some of that confusion between the
two versions which to some extent spoiled the text of Jerome, without
preserving to us in its purity the interesting translation of the
earlier Church.</p>

<p>Besides his labours as a transcriber, Cassiodorus, both as an original
author and a compiler, used his pen for the instruction of his
fellow-inmates at Vivarium.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commentary on the Psalms.</div>

<p>(1) He began and slowly completed a Commentary on the Psalms. This
very diffuse performance (which occupies more than five hundred
closely printed pages in Migne's edition) displays, in the opinion of
those who have carefully studied it<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>, a large amount of
acquaintance with the writings of the Fathers, and was probably looked
upon as a marvel of the human intellect by the Vivarian monks, for
whose benefit it was composed, and to whom it revealed, in the Psalms
which they were daily and nightly intoning, refutations of all the
heresies that had ever racked the Church, and the rudiments of all the
sciences that flourished in the world. It is impossible now for this
or any future age to do aught but lament over so much wasted
ingenuity, when we find the author maintaining that the whole of the
one hundred and fifty Psalms were written by King David, and that
Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun have only a mystical meaning; that the
first seventy represent the Old Testament, and the last eighty the
New, because we celebrate the Resurrection of Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> on the eighth
day of the week, and so forth. A closer study of the book might
perhaps discover in it some genuine additions to the sum of human
knowledge; but it is difficult to repress a murmur at the misdirected
industry which has preserved to us the whole of this ponderous
futility, while it has allowed the History of the Goths to perish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commentary on the Epistles.</div>

<p>(2) The 'Complexiones in Epistolas Apostolorum' (first published by
Maffei in 1721, from a MS. discovered by him at Verona) have at least
the merit of being far shorter than the Commentary on the Psalms.
Perhaps the only points of interest in them, even for theological
scholars, are that Cassiodorus evidently attributes the Epistle to the
Hebrews without hesitation to the Apostle Paul, and that he notices
the celebrated passage concerning the Three Heavenly Witnesses (1 John
v. 7) in a way which seems to imply that he found that passage in the
text of the Vulgate, though on examination his language is seen to be
consistent with the theory that these words are a gloss added by the
commentator himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Historia Tripartita.</div>

<p>(3) In order to supply the want of any full Church History in the
Latin tongue, a want which was probably felt not only by his own monks
but throughout the Churches of the West, Cassiodorus induced his
friend Epiphanius to translate from the Greek the ecclesiastical
histories of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret, and then himself fused
these three narratives into one, the well-known 'Historia Tripartita,'
which contains the story of the Church's fortunes from the accession
of Constantine to the thirty-second year of the reign of Theodosius II
(306-439). The fact that the numerous mistranslations of Epiphanius
have passed uncorrected, probably indicates that Cassiodorus' own
knowledge of Greek was but slight, and that he depended on his
coadjutor entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> for this part of the work. The 'Historia
Tripartita' has probably had a larger circulation than any other of
its author's works; but Cassiodorus himself thought so little of his
share in it, that he does not include it in the list of his writings
prefixed to the treatise 'De Orthographi&#226;.' And, in fact, the
inartistic way in which the three narratives are soldered together,
rather than recast into one symmetrical and harmonious whole, obliges
us to admit that Cassiodorus' work at this book was little more than
mechanical, and entitles him to scarcely any other praise than that of
industry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Institutiones Divinarum et Humanarum Lectionum.</div>

<p>(4) Of a different quality, though still partaking somewhat of the
nature of a compilation, was his chief educational treatise, the
'Institutiones Divinarum et Humanarum Lectionum<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.' About the year
543, some three or four years after his retirement from public life,
while he was slowly ploughing his way through the Commentary on the
Psalms, twenty of which he had already interpreted, he seems to have
laid it aside for a time in order to devote himself to this work,
which aimed more at instruction than at religious edification. In the
outset of this book he describes that unsuccessful attempt of his, to
which allusion has already been made, for the establishment of a
theological school in Rome, and continues that, 'as the rage of war
and the turbulence of strife in the Italian realm<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> had prevented
the fulfilment of this desire, he felt himself constrained by Divine
charity to write for his monks' behoof these <i>libri introductorii</i>, in
which, after the manner of a teacher, he would open to them the
series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> of the books of Holy Scripture, and would give them a
compendious acquaintance with secular literature.' As the book is not
written for the learned, he undertakes to abstain from 'affectata
eloquentia,' and he does in the main keep his promise. The simple,
straightforward style of the book, which occasionally rises into real
and 'unaffected eloquence' where the subject inspires him to make an
appeal to the hearts of his readers, presents a striking and
favourable contrast to the obscure and turgid phraseology in which the
perverted taste of the times caused him generally to shroud his
meaning<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>In the first part of this treatise (commonly called the 'De
Institutione Divinarum Litterarum') Cassiodorus briefly describes the
contents of the nine Codices<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> which made up the Scripture of the
Old and New Testaments, and mentions the names of the chief
commentators upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> each. After some important cautions as to the
preservation of the purity of the sacred text and abstinence from
plausible emendations, the author proceeds to enumerate the Christian
historians&#8212;Eusebius, Orosius, Marcellinus, Prosper, and others<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>;
and he then slightly sketches the characters of some of the principal
Fathers&#8212;Hilary, Cyprian, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine. This part of
the work contains an interesting allusion to 'Dionysius Monachus,
Scytha natione, sed moribus omnino Romanus,' of whom Cassiodorus
speaks as a colleague in his literary enterprises. This is the
so-called Dionysius Exiguus, who fixed (erroneously, as it now
appears) the era of the birth of Christ, and whose system of
chronology founded on this event has been accepted by all the nations
of Christendom. At the conclusion of this the first part of the
treatise we find some general remarks on the nature of the monastic
life, and some pictures of Vivarium and its neighbourhood, to which we
are indebted for some of the information contained in the preceding
pages. The book ends with a prayer, and contains thirty-three
chapters, the same number, remarks Cassiodorus (who is addicted to
this kind of moralising on numbers) that was reached by the years of
the life of Christ on earth.</p>

<p>The second part of the treatise, commonly called 'De Artibus ac
Disciplinis Liberalium Litterarum,' contains so much as the author
thought that every monk should be acquainted with concerning the four
liberal arts&#8212;Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Mathematics&#8212;the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> of
which is divided into the four 'disciplines' of Arithmetic, Geometry,
Music, and Astronomy. As illustrating the relative importance of these
sciences (as we call them) as apprehended by Cassiodorus, it is
curious to observe that while Geometry and Astronomy occupy only about
one page, and Arithmetic and Music two pages each, Logic takes up
eighteen pages, Grammar two, and Rhetoric six.</p>

<div class="sidenote">De Orthographi&#226;.</div>

<p>(5) Some other works, chiefly of a grammatical kind<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, which have
now perished, together with the exegetical treatises already named,
occupied the leisure hours of the old age of Cassiodorus. At length,
in the ninety-third year of his age, the veteran statesman, nobleman,
and judge crowned his life of useful service by writing for his
beloved monks his still extant treatise 'De Orthographi&#226;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.' He
tells us that the monks suddenly exclaimed, 'What doth it profit us to
study either those works which the ancients have composed or those
which your Wisdom has caused to be added to the list, if we are
altogether ignorant how we ought to write these things, and on the
other hand cannot understand and accurately represent in speech the
words which we find written?' In other words, 'Give us a treatise on
spelling.' The venerable teacher gladly complied with the request, and
compiled from twelve grammarians<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> various rules, the observance of
which would prevent the student from committing the usual faults in
spelling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> It is no doubt true<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> that this work is a mere collection
of excerpts from other authors, not arranged on any systematic
principle. Still, even as such a collection, it does great credit to
the industry of a nonagenarian; and it seems to me that there is much
in it which a person who was studying the transition of Latin into the
Lingua Volgare might peruse with profit. To an epigraphist especially
it must be interesting to see what were the mistakes which an
imperfectly educated Italian in that age was most likely to commit.
The confusion between <i>b</i> and <i>v</i> was evidently a great source of
error, and their nice discrimination, to which Cassiodorus devotes
four chapters, a very <i>crux</i> of accurate scholarship. We see also from
a passage in the 'De Institutione Divinarum Litterarum<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>' that the
practice of assimilating the last letter of the prefix in compound
words, like i<i>l</i>luminatio, i<i>r</i>risio, i<i>m</i>probus, though it had been
introduced, was as yet hardly universal; and similarly that the monks
required to be instructed to write qui<i>c</i>quam for euphony, instead of
qui<i>d</i>quam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Cassiodorus, 575 (?).</div>

<p>The treatise 'De Orthographi&#226;' was the last product, as far as we
know, of the industrious brain of Cassiodorus. Two years after its
composition the aged statesman and scholar, in the ninety-sixth year
of his age, entered into his well-earned rest<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. The death of
Cassiodorus occurred (as I believe) in the year 575, three years
before the death of the Emperor Justin II, nephew and successor of
Justinian. The period covered by his life had been one of vast
changes. Born when the Kingdom of Odovacar was only four years old,
he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> had as a young man seen that Kingdom overthrown by the arms of
Theodoric; he had sat by the cradle of the Ostrogothic monarchy, and
mourned over its grave; had seen the eunuch Narses supreme vicegerent
of the Emperor; had heard the avalanche of the Lombard invasion
thunder over Italy, and had outlived even the Lombard invader Alboin.
Pope Leo, the tamer of Attila and the hero of Chalcedon, had not been
dead twenty years when Cassiodorus was born. Pope Gregory the Great,
the converter of England, was within fifteen years of his accession to
the Pontificate when Cassiodorus died. The first great schism between
the Eastern and Western Churches was begun in his boyhood and ended
before he had reached old age. He saw the irretrievable ruin of Rome,
such as Augustus and Trajan had known her; the extinction of the Roman
Senate; the practical abolition of the Consulate; the close of the
schools of philosophy at Athens.</p>

<p>Reverting to the line of thought with which this chapter opened, if
one were asked to specify any single life which more than another was
in contact both with the Ancient World and the Modern, none could be
more suitably named than the life of Cassiodorus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chief conclusions which Mr. Evans came to after his two days'
study of the country about Squillace are these:&#8212;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of Scylacium.</div>

<p>I. The <b><a href="#err3">Scylacium</a></b> or Scolacium of Roman times, the city of Cassiodorus,
is not to be looked for at the modern Squillace, but at the place
called Roccella in the Italian military map, which Lenormant and Evans
know as <i>La Roccelletta del Vescovo di Squillace</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/image01.png" width="287" height="500" alt="map" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="images/image01b.png">[Enlarge]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>This place, which is about ten kilometres north-east of modern
Squillace, is on a little hill immediately overhanging the sea, while
Squillace is on a spur of the Apennines three or four miles distant
from the sea. Mr. Evans' chief reasons for identifying Roccella with
Scylacium are (1) its position, 'hanging like a cluster of grapes on
hills not so high as to make the ascent of them a weariness, but high
enough to command a delightful prospect over land and sea.' This
description by Cassiodorus exactly suits Roccella, but does not suit
Squillace, which is at the top of a conical hill, and is reached only
by a very toilsome ascent. 'With its gradual southern and eastern
slope and its freedom from overlooking heights (different in this
respect from Squillace),' says Mr. Evans, 'Roccella was emphatically,
as Cassiodorus describes it, &quot;a city of the sun.&quot;'</p>

<p>(2) Its ruins. While no remains of a pre-mediaeval time have been
discovered at Squillace, there is still standing at Roccella the shell
of a splendid basilica, of which Mr. Evans has taken some plans and
sketches, but which seems to have strangely escaped the notice of most
preceding travellers. The total length of this building is 94 paces,
the width of the nave 30, the extreme width of the transept 54. It has
three fine apses at the eastern end, and is built in the form of a
Latin cross. On either side of the nave was an exterior arcade, which
apparently consisted originally of eleven window arches, six of them
not being for the transmission of light. 'Altogether,' says Mr. Evans,
'this church, even in its dilapidated state, is one of the finest
monuments of the kind anywhere existing. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> should have to go to
Rome, to Ravenna, or to Thessalonica, to find its parallel; but I
doubt whether, even at any of those places, there is to be seen a
basilica with such fine exterior arcading. It is a great tribute to
the strength of the original fabric that so much should have survived
the repeated shocks of earthquake that have desolated Calabria, and
scarcely left one stone upon another of her ancient cities.'</p>

<p>After a careful examination of the architectural peculiarities of this
basilica, Mr. Evans is disposed to fix its erection somewhere about
the time of the Emperor Justinian.</p>

<p>In addition to this fine building there are at Roccella the ruins of
two smaller late Roman churches, mausolea, and endless foundations of
buildings which must have formed very extensive suburbs.</p>

<p>More important than all, the massive walls of a considerable city can
still be traced for nearly a mile in two parallel lines, with the
transverse wall which unites them. Certainly all these indications
seem to point to the existence at this spot of a great provincial city
of the Empire, and to make Mr. Evans' conjecture more probable than
that of M. Lenormant, who identified the ruins at Roccella with those
of Castra Hannibalis, the seaport of Scylacium. It would seem
probable, if Mr. Evans' theory be correct, that the city may have been
removed to its present site in the early middle ages, in order to
guard it against the incursions of the Saracens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Vivarian Monastery.</div>

<p>II. As to the situation of the <i>Vivarian Monastery</i> Mr. Evans comes to
nearly the same conclusion as M. Lenormant. Both place it on the
promontory of Squillace (eastward of Staletti), and, as Mr. Evans
observes, 'only such a position can be reconciled, on the one hand,
with the presence of an abundant stream and rich Campagna, on the
other with the neighbourhood of caves and grottoes on the sea-shore.'
But while M. Lenormant places it at a place called Coscia, almost
immediately to the north of and under Staletti, Mr. Evans pleads for
the site now occupied by the Church of S. Maria del Mare, on the cliff
top, very near the sea, and about three kilometres south of Staletti.
This church is itself of later date than Cassiodorus, and probably
formed part of the work of restoration undertaken by Nicephorus Phocas
in the Tenth Century; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> there are signs of its having formerly
joined on to a monastery, and some of the work about it looks as if
materials taken from the Cassiodorian edifice had been used in the
work of reconstruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fons Arethusae.</div>

<p>III. The <i>Fountain of Arethusa</i> may possibly, according to Mr. Evans,
be identified with the Fontana della Panaghia, a small fountain by the
sea-shore at the south end of a little bay under the promontory of S.
Gregorio. The so-called Fontana di Cassiodoro, near Coscia, has
received its name and its present appearance in modern times, and is
much too far from the sea to be the Fountain of Arethusa.</p>

<h3>THE ANECDOTON HOLDERI.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> pages must be devoted to the MS. bearing the somewhat uncouth
title of 'Anecdoton Holderi,' because it is the most recently opened
source of information as to the life and works of Cassiodorus, and one
which, if genuine, settles some questions which have been long and
vigorously debated among scholars.</p>

<p>My information on the subject is derived from a pamphlet of 79 pages
by Hermann Usener, printed at Bonn in 1877, and bearing the title
'Anecdoton Holderi: Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte Roms in Ostgothischer
Zeit.' I am indebted to Mr. Bywater, of Exeter College, Oxford, for my
introduction to this pamphlet, which, while strikingly confirming some
conclusions which I had come to from my own independent study of the
'Variae,' has been of the greatest possible service to me in studying
the lives of Cassiodorus and Boethius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Description of the MS.</div>

<p>The 'Anecdoton' (which loses its right to that name by Usener's
publication of it) was discovered by Alfred Holder in a MS. known as
Codex Augiensis, No. CVL, which came from the Monastery of Reichenau
and is now in the Grand-Ducal Library at Carlsruhe. The monks of the
fertile island of Reichenau (Augia Dives), in the Lake of Constance,
were celebrated in the ninth and tenth centuries for their zeal in the
collection and transcription of manuscripts. The well-known Codex
Augiensis (an uncial MS. of the Greek text of the New Testament, with
the Vulgate version in parallel columns)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> is referred by
palaeographers to the ninth century<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>. The Codex Augiensis with
which we are now concerned, and which is a copy of the 'Institutiones
Humanarum Rerum' of Cassiodorus, is believed to have been written in
the next succeeding century. On the last page of this MS. Holder
discovered the fragment&#8212;not properly belonging to the
'Institutiones'&#8212;to which he has given his name, and which is as
follows<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>:&#8212;</p>

<p>This memorandum, for it is hardly more, is a vestige, and the only
vestige now remaining, of a short tract by Cassiodorus on the literary
history of his family and kinsmen. The 'Excerpta' have been made by
some later hand&#8212;perhaps that of a monk in the Vivarian convent. To
him undoubtedly we owe the words 'monachi servi Dei' as a description
of Cassiodorus; probably also the 'ex-Patricio,' which is perhaps an
incorrect designation. 'Vir eruditissimus,' in the last paragraph, is
probably due to the same hand, as, with all his willingness to do
justice to his own good qualities, Cassiodorus would hardly have
spoken thus of himself in a work avowedly proceeding from his own pen.
The clause which is placed in brackets [et ... superposuit] is
probably also due to the copyist, anxious to supply what he deemed the
imperfections of his memorandum. In short, it must be admitted that
the fragment cannot consist of the very words of Cassiodorus in
however abbreviated a form. Still it contains so much that is
valuable, and that could hardly have been invented by any writer of a
post-Cassiodorian age, that it is well worthy of the careful and, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
to speak, microscopical examination to which it has been subjected by
Usener.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Date of the fragment.</div>

<p>The work from which these 'Excerpta' are taken was composed, according
to Usener, in the year 522. This is proved by the facts that the
receiver of the letter is spoken of as Magister Officiorum, a post
which he apparently held from Sept. 1, 521, to Sept. 1, 522; and that
the Consulship of the two sons of Boethius, which began on Jan. 1,
522, is also referred to. <span class="sidenote">Persons to whom addressed.</span>The name of the person to whom the letter is
addressed is given as Rufius Petronius Nicomachus. Usener, however,
shows good reason for thinking that his final name, the name by which
he was known in the consular lists, is omitted, and that his full
designation was Rufius Petronius Nicomachus Cethegus, Consul in 504,
Magister Officiorum (as above stated) in 521-522, and Patrician. He
was probably the same Cethegus whom Procopius mentions<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> as
Princeps Senatus, and as withdrawing from Rome to Centumcellae in the
year 545 because he was accused of treachery to the Imperial
cause<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its object.</div>

<p>The object of the little treatise referred to evidently was to give an
account of those members of the family to which Cassiodorus belonged
who had distinguished themselves in literature. The words 'Ex genere
Cassiodororum' are perhaps a gloss of the transcribers. At least it
does not appear that they would correctly describe the descent of
Symmachus and Boethius, though they were relations of Cassiodorus,
being de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>scended from or allied to the great house of the Aurelii from
which he also sprang. Probably several other names may have been
noticed in the original treatise, but the only three as to which the
'Anecdoton' informs us are the three as to whom information is most
acceptable&#8212;Symmachus, Boethius, and Cassiodorus himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Information as to life of Symmachus.</div>

<p>I. The name of Q. Aurelius Memmius <i>Symmachus</i> was already known to us
as that of the friend, guardian, and father-in-law of Boethius, and
his fellow-sufferer from the outburst of suspicious rage which
disgraced the last years of Theodoric. That he was Consul in 485
(under the dominion of Odovacar), and that he had at the time of his
fall attained the honoured position of Father of the Senate<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>, we
also know from the 'Consular Fasti' and the 'Anonymus Valesii.' This
extract tells us that he had attained the rank of Patricius, which may
perhaps have been bestowed upon him when he laid down the Consulship.
He was 'a philosopher, and a modern imitator of the ancient Cato; but
surpassed the virtues of the men of old by [his devotion to] our most
holy religion.' This sentence quite accords with all that we hear of
the character of Symmachus from our other authorities&#8212;the 'Anonymus
Valesii,' Procopius, and Boethius. The blending of old Roman gravity
and Christian piety in such a man's disposition is happily indicated
in the words before us. It would be an interesting commentary upon
them if we were to contrast the career of the Christian Symmachus, who
suffered in some sense as a martyr for the Nicene Creed under
Theodoric, with that of his ancestor the Pagan Symmachus, who, 143
years before, incurred the anger of Gratian by his protests against
the removal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> Altar of Victory from the Senate House, and the
curtailment of the grant to the Vestal Virgins.</p>

<p>The Symmachus with whom we are now concerned was also an orator; and
we learn from this extract that he delivered a speech, evidently of
some importance, in the Senate, 'pro allecticiis.' There seems much
probability in Usener's contention that these 'allecticii' were men
who had been 'allecti,' or admitted by co-optation into the Senate
during the reign of Odovacar, and whom, on the downfall of that ruler,
it had been proposed to strip of their recently acquired dignity&#8212;a
proposal which seems to have been successfully resisted by Symmachus
and his friends.</p>

<p>Lastly, we learn that Symmachus, 'in imitation of his ancestors,' put
forth a Roman History in seven books. The expression for ancestors
(parentes) here used is thought by Usener to refer chiefly to Virius
Nicomachus Flavianus (Consul in 394<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>), whose granddaughter married
Q. Fabius Memmius Symmachus, and was the grandmother of our Symmachus.
This Flavianus, who was in his time one of the chief leaders of the
heathen party in the Senate, is spoken of in one inscription as
'historicus disertissimus;' and in another, mention is made of the
fact that he dedicated his annals to Theodosius.</p>

<p>Whether the elder Symmachus, the Pagan champion, was a historian as
well as an orator is a matter about which there is a good deal of
doubt. Jordanes twice quotes 'The History of Symmachus,' once as to
the elevation of the Emperor Maximin, and once as to his death<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.
Usener thinks that the 'Anecdoton Holderi' authorises us henceforward
to assign these quotations without doubt to the younger, Christian
Symmachus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> not to his Pagan ancestor. To me the allusion to
<i>parentes</i> (in the plural), whose industry as historians the Symmachus
there spoken of imitated, seems to make it at least as probable that
the earlier, not the later member of the family composed the history
which is here quoted by Jordanes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Information as to life of Boethius.</div>

<p>II. We now pass on to consider the information furnished by this
fragment as to the illustrious son-in-law of Symmachus, Anicius
Manlius Severinus <i>Boethius</i>. Of the facts of his life we had already
pretty full information, from the autobiographical sections of the
'Consolation of Philosophy' and other sources. He does not indeed
mention the exact year of his birth, but the allusion to 'untimely
gray hairs' which he makes in that work, written in 523 or 524,
together with other indications<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> as to his age, entitle us to fix
it at about 480, certainly not earlier than that year. The death of
his father (who was Consul in 487) occurred while he was still a
child. Symmachus, as has been already said, was the guardian of his
youth and the friend of his manhood, and gave him his daughter
Rusticiana to wife. That he received the honour of the Consulship in
510 we know from the 'Fasti Consulares;' but it is perplexing to find
him even before that year spoken of<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> as Patricius, since this
honour was generally bestowed only on those who had already sat in the
curule chair of the Consul<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. The high consideration in which he
was held at the Court of Theodoric, and the value placed upon his
scientific attainments, are sufficiently proved by the letters in the
following collec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>tion, especially by those in which he is consulted
about the frauds committed by the officers of the Mint, about the

In the year 522 his two sons, Symmachus and Boethius, though they had
but just attained to man's estate, received the honour of the
Consulship, upon which occasion the proud and happy father pronounced
a panegyric upon Theodoric before the assembled Senate. Some of these
facts in the life of Boethius are referred to in the extract before
us, which, as was before said, appears to be taken from a treatise
composed in this same year 522, the year of the Consulship of the
young Boethii. Of their father's investiture with the office of
<i>Magister Officiorum</i> on September 1, 522, of his sudden fall from the
royal favour, of the charge of treason which was preferred against him
before the end of that year, of his imprisonment during 523 and
execution (probably in the early part of 524), we have of course no
trace in this extract; and the fact that we have none is a strong
argument for the genuineness and contemporary character of the
treatise from which it is taken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His theological treatises.</div>

<p>So far, then, we have in the 'Anecdoton Holderi' only a somewhat
meagre reiteration of facts already known to us. But when we come to
the statement of the literary labours of Boethius the case is entirely
altered. It is well known that in the Middle Ages certain treatises on
disputed points of Christian theology were attributed to him as their
author. They are:&#8212;</p>

<p>1. A treatise 'De Sancta Trinitate.'</p>

<p>2. 'Ad Johannem Diaconum: Utrum Pater et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus de
Divinitate substantialiter praedicentur.'</p>

<p>3. 'Ad eundem: Quomodo substantiae in eo quod sint bonae sint cum non
sint substantialia bona.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>4. 'De Fide Catholica.'</p>

<p>5. 'Contra Eutychen et Nestorium.'</p>

<p>It may be said at once that in the earlier MSS. the fourth treatise is
not attributed to Boethius. It seems to have been included with the
others by some mistake, and I shall therefore in the following remarks
assume that it is not his, and shall confine my attention to the first
three and the fifth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty as to religious position of Boethius.</div>

<p>Even as to these, notwithstanding the nearly unanimous voice of the
early Middle Ages (as represented by MSS. of the Ninth, Tenth, and
Eleventh Centuries) assigning them to Boethius as their author,
scholars, especially recent scholars, have felt the gravest possible
doubts of their being really his, doubts which have of late ripened
into an almost complete certainty that he was not their author. The
difficulty does not arise from anything in the diction or in the
theology which points to a later age as the time of their composition,
but from the startling contrast which they present to the religious
atmosphere of the 'Consolation of Philosophy.' Here, in these
theological treatises, we have the author entering cheerfully into the
most abstruse points of the controversy concerning the Nature of
Christ, without apparently one wavering thought as to the Deity of the
Son of Mary. There, in the 'Consolation,' a book written in prison and
in disgrace, with death at the executioner's hands impending over
him&#8212;a book in which above all others we should have expected a man
possessing the Christian faith to dwell upon the promises of
Christianity&#8212;the name of Christ is never once mentioned, the tone,
though religious and reverential, is that of a Theist only; and from
beginning to end, except one or two sentences in which an obscure
allusion may possibly be detected to the Christian revelation, there
is nothing which might not have been written by a Greek philosopher
ignorant of the very name of Christianity. Of the various attempts
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> have been made to solve this riddle perhaps the most ingenious
is that of M. Charles Jourdain, who, in a monograph devoted to the
subject<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>, seeks to prove that the author of the theological
treatises referred to was a certain Boethus, an African Bishop of the
Byzacene Province, who was banished to Sardinia about the year 504 by
the Vandal King Thrasamond.</p>

<p>Not thus, however, as it now appears, is the knot to be cut. And after
all, M. Jourdain, in arguing, as he seems disposed to argue, against
any external profession of Christianity on the part of Boethius,
introduces contradictions greater than any that his theory would
remove. To any person acquainted with the thoughts and words of the
little coterie of Roman nobles to which Boethius belonged, it will
seem absolutely impossible that the son-in-law of Symmachus, the
receiver of the praises of Ennodius and Cassiodorus, should have been
a professed votary of the old Paganism. It is not the theological
treatises coming from a man in his position which are hard to account
for; it is the apparently non-Christian tone of the 'Consolation.'</p>

<p>The fragment now before us shows that the old-fashioned belief in
Boethius as a theologian was well founded. 'He wrote a book concerning
the Holy Trinity, and certain dogmatic chapters, and a book against
Nestorius.' That is a sufficiently accurate <i>resum&#233;</i> of the four
theological treatises enumerated above. Here Usener also observes&#8212;and
I am inclined to agree with him&#8212;that there is a certain resemblance
between the style of thought of these treatises and that of the
'Consolation' itself. They are, after all, philosophical rather than
religious; one of the earliest samples of that kind of logical
discussion of theological dogmas which the Schoolmen of the Middle
Ages so delighted to indulge in. The young philosopher, hearing at his
father-in-law's table the discussions between Chalce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>donian and
Monophysite with which all Rome resounded, on account of the prolonged
strife with the Church of Constantinople, set himself down to discuss
the same topics which they were wrangling over by the light&#8212;to him so
clear and precious&#8212;of the Greek philosophy. There was perhaps in this
employment neither reverence nor irreverence. He had not St.
Augustine's intense and almost passionate conviction of the truth of
Christianity; but he was quite willing to accept it and to discourse
upon it, as he discoursed on Arithmetic, Music, and Geometry.</p>

<p>But when premature old age, solitude, and the loss of liberty befell
him, it was not to the highly elaborated Christian theology of the
Sixth Century that he turned for support and consolation. Probably
enough the very fact that he knew some of the pitfalls in the way
deterred him from that dangerous journey, where the slightest
deviation on either side landed him in some detested heresy, the
heresy of Nestorius or of Eutyches. 'On revient toujours &#224; ses
premiers amours;' and even so Boethius, though undoubtedly professing
himself a Christian, and about to die in full communion with the
Catholic Church, turned for comfort in his dungeon to the
philosophical studies of his youth, especially to the ethical writings
of Plato and Aristotle.</p>

<p>After all, the title of the treatise is '<i>Philosophiae</i> Consolatio;'
and however vigorous a literature of philosophy may in the course of
centuries have grown up in the Christian domain, in the sixth century
the remembrance of the old opposition between Christianity and
Philosophy was perhaps still too strong for a writer to do anything
more than stand neutral as to the distinctive claims of Christianity,
when he had for the time donned the cloak of the philosopher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bucolic Poem of Boethius.</div>

<p>We learn from the fragment before us that Boethius also wrote a
'Bucolic Poem.' This is an interesting fact, and helps to explain the
facility with which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> breaks into song in the midst of the
'Consolation.' It may have been to this effort of the imagination that
he alluded when he said at the beginning of that work&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Carmina qui quondam studio florente peregi<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flebilis, heu, moestos cogor inire modos.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We would gladly know something more of this 'Bucolic Poem' indited by
the universal genius, Boethius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cassiodorus.</div>

<p>III. As for <i>Cassiodorus</i> himself, the additional information
furnished by this fragment has been already discussed in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">foregoing
chapter</a>. That he was <i>Consilarius</i> to his father during his
Praefecture, and that in that capacity he recited an eloquent
panegyric on Theodoric, which was rewarded by his promotion to the
high office of the Quaestorship, are facts which we learn from this
fragment only; and they are of high importance, not only for the life
of Cassiodorus but for the history of Europe at the beginning of the
Sixth Century, because they make it impossible to assign to any letter
in the 'Variae' an earlier date than 500.</p>

<h3>THE GRADATIONS OF OFFICIAL RANK IN THE LATER EMPIRE.</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Official Hierarchy introduced by Diocletian.</div>

<p>It is well known that Diocletian introduced and Constantine perfected
an elaborate system of administration under which the titles,
functions, order of precedence, and number of attendants of the
various officers of the Civil Service as well as of the Imperial army
were minutely and punctiliously regulated. This system, which, as
forming the pattern upon which the nobility of mediaeval Europe was to
a great extent modelled, perhaps deserves even more careful study than
it has yet received, is admirably illustrated by the letters of
Cassiodorus. The <i>Notitia Utriusque Imperii</i>, our copies of which must
have been compiled in the early years of the Fifth Century, furnishes
us with a picture of official life which, after we have made allowance
for the fact that the Empire of the West has shrunk into the
Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy (with the addition of Dalmatia and some
other portions of Illyricum), is almost precisely reproduced in the
pages of the 'Various Letters.' In order that the student may
understand the full significance of many passages in those letters,
and especially of the superscriptions by which each letter is
prefaced, it will be well to give a brief outline of the system which
existed alike under Theodosius and Theodoric.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nobilissimi.</div>

<p>In the first place, then, we come to what is rather a family than a
class, the persons bearing the title <i>Nobilissimus</i><a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. These were
the nearest relatives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> the reigning Emperor; his brothers, sisters,
sons, and daughters. The title therefore is not unlike that of Royal
or Imperial Highness in modern monarchies. I am not sure whether any
trace can be found of the survival of this title in the Ostrogothic
Court. Theodahad, nephew of Theodoric, is addressed simply as 'Vir
Senator<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>,' and he is spoken of as 'praecelsus et amplissimus
vir<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.' It is not so, however, in respect of the three great
official classes which follow&#8212;the Illustres, Spectabiles, and
Clarissimi&#8212;whose titles were rendered as punctiliously in the Italy
of Theodoric as ever they were in the Italy of Diocletian and
Constantine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustres.</div>

<p>I. The <i>Illustres</i> were a small and select circle of men, the chief
depositaries of power after the Sovereign, and they may with some
truth be compared to the Cabinet Ministers of our own political
system. The 'Notitia' mentions thirteen of them as bearing rule in the
Western Empire. They are:</p>

<p>1. The Praetorian Praefect of Italy.</p>

<p>2. The Praetorian Praefect of the Gauls.</p>

<p>3. The Praefect of the City of Rome.</p>

<p>4. The Master of the Foot Guards (Magister Peditum in Praesenti).</p>

<p>5. The Master of the Horse Guards (Magister Equitum in Praesenti).</p>

<p>6. The Master of the Horse for the Gauls (per Gallias).</p>

<p>7. The Grand Chamberlain (Praepositus Sacri Cubiculi).</p>

<p>8. The Master of the Offices.</p>

<p>9. The Quaestor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>10. The Count of Sacred Largesses.</p>

<p>11. The Count of the Private Domains (Comes Rerum Privatarum).</p>

<p>12. The Count of the Household Cavalry (Comes Domesticorum Equitum).</p>

<p>13. The Count of the Household Infantry (Comes Domesticorum Peditum).</p>

<p>Substantially these same titles were borne by the Illustres to whom
Cassiodorus (himself one of them) addressed his 'Various Letters.' The
second and the sixth (the Praetorian Praefect of the Gauls, and the
Master of the Horse for the Gauls) may possibly have disappeared; and
yet, in view of the fact that Theodoric was during the greater part of
his reign ruler of a portion of Gaul, it is not necessary to assume
even this change. Into the question of the military officers I will
not enter, as I confess that I do not understand the relations
(whether co-ordinate or subordinated one to another) of the two pairs
of officers, Nos. 4 and 5 and Nos. 12 and 13.</p>

<p>The rank and duties of the Praetorian Praefect of Italy, the Master of
the Offices, and the Quaestor have already been described in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">first
chapter</a>. It will be well to say a few words as to the four remaining
civil dignitaries, the Praefect of the City, the Grand Chamberlain,
the Count of Sacred Largesses, and the Count of the Private Domains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Praefect of the City.</div>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The <i>Praefectus Urbis Romae</i> was by virtue of his office head of
the Senate. He had the care of the Annona or corn-largesses to the
people, the command of the City-watch, and the duty of keeping the
aqueducts in proper repair. The shores and channel of the Tiber, the
vast <i>cloacae</i> which carried off the refuse of the City, the quays and
warehouses of Portus at the river's mouth were also under his
authority. The officer who was charged with taking the census, the
officers charged with levying the duties on wine, the masters of the
markets, the superintendents of the granaries, the curators of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> the
statues, baths, theatres, and the other public buildings with which
the City was adorned, all owned the supreme control of the Urban
Praefect. At the beginning of the Fifth Century the <i>Vicarius Urbis</i>
(whom it is difficult not to think of as in some sort subject to the
<i>Praefectus Urbis</i>), had jurisdiction over all central and southern
Italy and Sicily. But if this was the arrangement then, it must have
been altered before the time of Cassiodorus, who certainly appears as
Praetorian Praefect to have wielded authority over the greater part of
Italy. He states, however<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>, that the Urban Praefect had, by an
ancient law, jurisdiction, not only over Rome itself, but over all the
district within 100 miles of the capital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grand Chamberlain.</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <i>Praepositus Sacri Cubiculi</i> had under his orders the large
staff of Grooms of the Bedchamber, at whose head stood the
<i>Primicerius Cubiculariorum</i>, an officer of 'respectable' rank. The
<i>Castrensis</i>, Butler or Seneschal, with his army of lacqueys and pages
who attended to the spreading and serving of the royal table; the
<i>Comes Sacrae Vestis</i>, who with similar assistance took charge of the
royal wardrobe; the <i>Comes Domorum</i>, who perhaps superintended the
needful repairs of the royal palace, all took their orders in the last
resort from the Grand Chamberlain. So, too, did the three Decurions,
officers with a splendid career of advancement before them, who
marshalled the thirty brilliantly armed Silentiarii, that paced
backwards and forwards before the purple veil guarding the slumbers of
the Sovereign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Count of Sacred Largesses.</div>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The <i>Comes Sacrarum Largitionum</i>, theoretically only the Grand
Almoner of the Sovereign, discharged in practice many of the duties of
Chancellor of the Exchequer. The mines, the mint, the Imperial linen
factories, the receipt of the tribute of the Provinces, and many other
departments of the public revenue were originally under the care of
this functionary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> whose office however, as we are expressly told by
Cassiodorus, had lost part of its lustre, probably by a transfer of
some of these duties to the Count of the Private Domains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Count of Private Domains.</div>

<p>(<i>d</i>) This Minister, the <i>Comes Rerum Privatarum</i>, had the
superintendence of the Imperial estates in Italy and the Provinces.
Confiscations and the absorption by the State of the properties of
defaulting tax-payers were probably always tending to increase the
extent of these estates, and to make the office of Count of the Domain
more important. The collection of the land-tax, far the most important
item of the Imperial revenue, was also made subject to his authority.
Finally, in order, as Cassiodorus quaintly observes<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, that his
jurisdiction should not be exercised only over slaves (the cultivators
of the State domains), some authority was given to him within the
City, and by a curious division of labour all charges of incestuous
crime, or of the spoliation of graves, were brought before the
tribunal of the Comes Privatarum.</p>

<p>Besides the thirteen persons who, as acting Ministers of the highest
class, were entitled to the designation of Illustris, there were also
those whom we may call honorary members of the class: the persons who
had received the dignity of the Patriciate&#8212;a dignity which was
frequently bestowed on those who had filled the office of Consul, and
which, unlike the others of which we have been speaking, was held for
life.</p>

<p>It is a question on which I think we need further information, whether
a person who had once filled an Illustrious office lost the right to
be so addressed on vacating it. I am not sure that we have any clear
case in the following collection of an ex-official holding this
courtesy-rank; but it seems probable that such would be the case.</p>

<p>Considering also the great show of honour with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> the Consulate,
though now destitute of all real power, was still greeted, it seems
probable that the Consuls for the year would rank as Illustres; but
here, too, we seem to require fuller details.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spectabiles.</div>

<p>II. We now come to the Second Class, the <i>Spectabiles</i>, which consists
chiefly of the lieutenants and deputies of the Illustres.</p>

<p>For instance, every Praetorian Praefect had immediately under him a
certain number of <i>Vicarii</i>, each of whom was a Spectabilis. The
Praefecture included an extent of territory equivalent to two or three
countries of Modern Europe (for instance, the Praefecture of the Gauls
embraced Britain, Gaul, a considerable slice of Germany, Spain, and
Morocco). This was divided into Dioceses (in the instance above
referred to Britain formed one Diocese, Gaul another, and Spain with
its attendant portion of Africa a third), and the Diocese was again
divided into Provinces. The title of the ruler of the Diocese, who in
his restricted but still ample domain wielded a similar authority to
that of the Illustrious Praefect, was <i>Spectabilis Vicarius</i>.</p>

<p>But the Praefect and the Vicar controlled only the civil government of
the territories over which they respectively bore sway. The military
command of the Diocese was vested in a <i>Spectabilis Comes</i>, who was
under the orders of the Illustrious Magister Militum. Subordinate in
some way to the Comes was the <i>Dux</i>, who was also a Spectabilis, but
whose precise relation to his superior the Comes is, to me at least,
not yet clear<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>Besides these three classes of dignitaries, the <i>Castrensis</i>, who was
a kind of head steward in the Imperial household, and most of the
Heads of Departments in the great administrative offices, such as the
<i>Primicerius Notariorum</i> and the <i>Magistri Scriniorum</i><a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, bore the
title of Spectabilis. We have perhaps hardly sufficient data for an
exact calculation, but I conjecture that there would be as many as
fifty or sixty Spectabiles in the Kingdom of Theodoric.</p>

<p>It appears to me that the epithet <i>Sublimis</i> (which is almost unknown
to the Theodosian Code), when it occurs in the 'Variae' is used as
synonymous with Spectabilis<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clarissimi.</div>

<p>III. The <i>Clarissimi</i> were the third rank in the official hierarchy.
To our minds it may appear strange that the 'most renowned' should
come below 'the respectable,' but such was the Imperial pleasure. The
title 'Clarissimus' had moreover its own value, for from the time of
Constantine onwards it was conferred on all the members of the Senate,
and was in fact identical with Senator<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>; and this was doubtless,
as Usener points out<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>, the reason why the letters Cl. were still
appended to a Roman nobleman's name after he had risen higher in the
official scale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> and was entitled to be called Spectabilis or
Illustris. The <i>Consulares</i> or <i>Correctores</i>, who administered the
Provinces under the Vicarii, were called Clarissimi; and we shall
observe in the collection before us many other cases in which the
title is given to men in high, but not the highest, positions in the
Civil Service of the State.</p>

<p>Besides the three classes above enumerated there were also:&#8212;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perfectissimi.</div>

<p>IV. The <i>Perfectissimi</i>, to which some of the smaller provincial
governors belonged, as well as some of the clerks in the Revenue
Offices (Numerarii) who had seen long service, and even some veteran
Decurions.</p>

<p>Below these again were:&#8212;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egregii.</div>

<p>V. The <i>Egregii</i>, who were also Decurions who had earned a right to
promotion, or even what we should call veteran non-commissioned
officers in the army (Primipilares).</p>

<p>But of these two classes slight mention is made in the Theodosian
Code, and none at all (I believe) in the 'Notitia' or the 'Letters of
Cassiodorus.'</p>

<h3>ON THE OFFICIUM OF THE PRAEFECTUS PRAETORIO<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Military character of the Roman Civil Service.</div>

<p>The official staff that served under the Roman governors of high rank
was an elaborately organised body, with a carefully arranged system of
promotion, and liberal superannuation allowances for those of its
members who had attained a certain position in the office.</p>

<p>Although, in consequence of the changes introduced by Diocletian and
Constantine, the civil and military functions had been for the most
part divided from one another, and it was now unusual to see the same
magistrate riding at the head of armies and hearing causes in the
Praetorium, in theory the officers of the Courts of Justice were still
military officers. Their service was spoken of as a <i>militia</i>; the
type of their office was the <i>cingulum</i>, or military belt; and one of
the leading officers of the court, as we shall see, was styled
<i>Cornicularius</i>, or trumpeter.</p>

<p>The Praetorian Praefect, whose office had been at first a purely
military one, had now for centuries been chiefly concerned in civil
administration, and as Judge over the highest court of appeal in the
Empire. His <i>Officium</i> (or staff of subordinates) was, at any rate in
the Fifth Century, still the most complete and highly developed that
served under any great functionary; and probably the career which it
offered to its members was more brilliant than any that they could
look for elsewhere. Accordingly, in studying the composition of this
body we shall familiarise ourselves with the type to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> all the
other <i>officia</i> throughout the Empire more or less closely
approximated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources of information as to the Officium.</div>

<p>Our chief information as to this elaborate official hierarchy is
derived from three sources<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>:&#8212;</p>

<p>(1) The <i>Notitia Dignitatum</i>, the great Official Gazetteer of the
Empire<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>, which in its existing shape appears to date from the
reign of Arcadius and Honorius, early in the Fifth Century.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>De Magistratibus</i> of Joannes Lydus, composed by a civil
servant of the Eastern Empire in the middle of the Sixth Century.</p>

<p>(3) The <i>Variae Epistolae</i> of Cassiodorus, the composition of which
ranges from about 504 to 540.</p>

<p>The first of these authorities relates to the Eastern and Western
Empires, the second to the Eastern alone, the third to the Western
Empire as represented by the Ostrogothic Kingdom founded by Theodoric.</p>

<p>Much light is also thrown on the subject by the Codes of Theodosius
and Justinian.</p>

<p>Godefroy's Commentary on the Theodosian Code, and Bethmann Hollweg's
'Gerichtsverfassung des sinkenden R&#246;mischen Reichs,' are the chief
modern works which have treated of the subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Officium as described in the Notitia.</div>

<p>We will follow the order in which the various offices are arranged by
the 'Notitia,' which is most likely to correspond with that of
official precedence.</p>

<p>In the second chapter of the 'Notitia Orientis,' after an enumeration
of the five Dioceses and forty-six Provinces which are 'sub
dispositione viri illustris Praefecti Praetorio per Orientem,' we have
this list, 'Officium viri illustris Praefecti Praetorio Orientis:'</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>

</p></div>

<p>The lists of the officia of all the other Praetorian Praefects in the
'Notitia' are exactly the same as this, except that under the head
'Praefectus Praetorio per Illyricum' we have, instead of the simple
entry 'Numerarii,'</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Numerarii quatuor: in his auri unus, operum alter;'</p></div>

<p>and the 'Praefectus Urbis Romae' had under his Numerarii, a</p>

<p>and between the 'Adjutores' and 'Singularii,'</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>

</p></div>

<p>We will go through the offices enumerated above in order:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Princeps.</div>

<p>(1) The <span class="smcap">Princeps</span> was the head of the whole official staff. In the case
of the officium of the Praetorian Praefect, however, this officer
seems, after the compilation of the 'Notitia,' to have disappeared,
and his rights and privileges became vested in the Cornicularius. It
will be observed that in the letters of Cassiodorus to the members of
his staff there is none addressed to the Princeps; and similarly there
is no mention of a Princeps as serving under the Praetorian Praefect
in the treatise of Lydus. This elimination of the Princeps, however,
was not universally applicable to all the officia. Cassiodorus (xi.
35) mentions a <i>Princeps Augustorum</i>, who was, perhaps, Princeps of
the <i>Agentes in Rebus</i>; and Lydus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> more distinctly ('De Mag.' iii. 24)
speaks of a bargain made between the Cornicularius of the Praetorian
Praefect and the <span lang="el" title="Greek: Prinkips tôn magistrianôn">&#928;&#961;&#953;&#947;&#954;&#953;&#960;&#962; &#964;&#969;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span>, who must be
supposed to be Princeps in the officium of the <i>Magister Officiorum</i>,
though no such officer appears in the 'Notitia<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.'</p>

<p>Speaking generally, however, we may perhaps say that the greater part
of what we are about to hear concerning the rights and endowments of
the Cornicularius in the Praefect's office might be truly asserted of
the Princeps at the time when the 'Notitia' was compiled, before the
two offices had been amalgamated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cornicularius.</div>

<p>(2) The <i>Cornicularius</i>. As to this officer we have a good many
details in the pages of Joannes Lydus. The antiquarian and
etymological part of his information must generally be received with
caution; but as to the actual privileges of the office in the days of
Justinian we may very safely speak after him, since it was an office
which he himself held, and whose curtailed gains and privileges caused
him bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>'The foremost in rank,' says he<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>, 'of the Emperor's assistants
(Adjutores) is even to this day called <i>Cornicularius</i>, that is to say
<i>horned</i> (<span lang="el" title="Greek: keraïtês">&#954;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>), or <i>fighting in the front rank</i>. For the
place of the monarch or the Caesar was in the middle of the army,
where he alone might direct the stress of battle. This being the
Emperor's place, according to Frontinus, on the left wing was posted
the Praefect or Master of the Horse, and on the right the Praetors or
Legati, the latter being the officers left in charge of the army when
their year of office was drawing to a close, to hold the command till
the new Consul should come out to take it from them.</p>

<p>'Of the whole Legion then, amounting to 6,000 men, exclusive of
cavalry and auxiliaries, as I before said, the <i>Cornicularius</i> took
the foremost place; and for that reason he still presides over the
whole [civil] service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> now that the Praefect, for reasons before
stated, no longer goes forth to battle.</p>

<p>'Since, then, all the rest of the staff are called assistants
(<i>Adjutores</i>), the Praefect gives an intimation under his own hand to
him who is entering the service in what department (<span lang="el" title="Greek: katalogos">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>)
he is ordered to take up his station<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. And the
following are the names of all the departments of the service. First
the <i>Cornicularius</i>, resplendent in all the dignity of a so-called
Count (<span lang="el" title="Greek: komês">&#954;&#959;&#956;&#951;&#962;</span>; comes; companion), but having not yet laid
aside his belt of office, nor received the honour of admission to the
palace, or what they call brevet-rank (<i>codicilli vacantes</i>), which
honour at the end of his term of service is given to him, and to none
of the other chiefs of departments<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.</p>

<p>'And after the Cornicularius follow:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
'2 Primiscrinii,<br />
'2 Commentarisii,<br />
'2 Regendarii,<br />
'2 Curae Epistolarum,<br />
'15 Scholae of Exceptores,<br />
</p></div>

<p>and then the &quot;unlearned service&quot; of the Singularii<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.'</p>

<p>Again, further on<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>, Lydus, who delights to 'magnify his office,'
gives us this further information as to the rank and functions of the
Cornicularius:</p>

<p>'Now that, if I am not mistaken, we have described all the various
official grades, it is meet to set forth the history of the
Cornicularius, the venerable head of the Civil Service, the man who,
as beginning and ending, sums up in himself the complete history of
the whole official order. The mere antiquity of his office is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
sufficient to establish his credit, seeing that he was the leader of
his troop for 1,300 years, and made his appearance in the world at the
same time with the sacred City of Rome itself: for the Cornicularius
was, from the first, attendant on the Master of the Horse, and the
Master of the Horse on the King, and thus the Cornicularius, if he
retained nothing of his office but the name, would still be connected
with the very beginnings of the Roman State.</p>

<p>'But from the time when Domitian appointed Fuscus to the office of
Praefect of the Praetorians (an office which had been instituted by
Augustus), and abolished the rank of Master of the Horse, taking upon
himself the command of the army<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>, everything was changed.
Henceforward, therefore, all affairs that were transacted in the
office of the Praefect were arranged by the Cornicularius alone, and
he received the revenues arising from them for his own refreshment.
This usage, which prevailed from the days of Domitian to our own
Theodosius, was then changed, on account of the usurpation of Rufinus.
For the Emperor Arcadius, fearing the overgrown power of the
Praefectoral office, passed a law that the Princeps of the Magister
[Officiorum]'s staff<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> ... should appear in the highest courts, and
should busy himself with part of the Praefect's duties, and especially
should enquire into the principle upon which orders for the Imperial
post-horses (<span lang="el" title="Greek: synthêmata">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>; <i>evectiones</i>) were granted<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>....
This order of Arcadius was inscribed in the earlier editions of the
Theodosian Code, but has been omitted in the later as superfluous.</p>

<p>'Thus, then, the Princeps of the Magistriani, being introduced into
the highest courts, but possessing nothing there beyond his mere empty
dignity, made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> bargain with the Cornicularius of the day, the object
of which was to open up to him some portion of the business; and,
having come to terms, the Princeps agreed to hand over to the
Cornicularius one pound's weight of gold [&#163;40] monthly, and to give
instant gratuities to all his subordinates according to their rank in
the service. In consequence of this compact the Cornicularius then in
office, after receiving his 12 lbs. weight of gold without any
abatement, with every show of honour conceded to his superior<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> (?)
the preferential right of introducing &quot;one-membered&quot; cases
(<span lang="el" title="Greek: tên tôn monomerôn entuchiôn eisagôgên">&#964;&#951;&#957; &#964;&#969;&#957; &#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#957; &#949;&#957;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#969;&#957; &#949;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#951;&#957;</span>), having reserved to himself,
beside the fees paid for promotion in the office<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>, and other
sources of gain, especially the sole right of subscribing the <i>Acta</i>
of the court, and thus provided for himself a yearly revenue of not
less than 1,000 aurei [&#163;600].'</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to translate as clearly as possible the obscure
words of Lydus as to this bargain between the two court-officers. The
complaint of Lydus appears to be that the Cornicularius of the day, by
taking the money of the Princeps Magistrianorum, and conceding to him
in return the preferential claim to manage 'one-membered' cases (or
unopposed business), made a purse for himself, but prepared the way
for the ruin of his successors. The monthly payment was, I think, to
be made for twelve months only, and thus the whole amount which the
Cornicularius received from this source was only &#163;480, but from other
sources&#8212;chiefly the sums paid for promotion by the subordinate
members of the <i>officium</i>, and the fees charged by him for affixing
his subscription to the <i>acta</i> of the court&#8212;he still remained in
receipt of a yearly revenue of &#163;600.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jealousy between the Officia of the Praefect and the
Magister.</div>

<p>The jealousy between the Officia of the Praetorian Praefect and the
Magister Officiorum was intense. Almost every line in the treatise of
Lydus testifies to it, and shows that the former office, in which he
had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> misfortune to serve, was being roughly shouldered out of the
way by its younger and more unscrupulous competitor.</p>

<p>Lydus continues<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>: 'Now, what followed, like the Peleus of
Euripides, I can never describe without tears. For on account of all
these sources of revenue having been dried up, I myself have had to
bear my part in the general misery of our time, since, though I have
reached the highest grade of promotion in the service, I have derived
nothing from it but the bare name. I do not blush to call Justice
herself as a witness to the truth of what I say, when I affirm that I
am not conscious of having received one obol from the Princeps, nor
from the Letters Patent for promotions in the office<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. For indeed
whence should I have derived it, since it was the ancient custom that
those who in any way appeared in the highest courts should pay to the
<i>officium</i> seven and thirty <i>aurei</i> [&#163;22] for a &quot;one-membered&quot; suit;
but ever after this bargain was made there has been given only a very
moderate sum of copper&#8212;not gold&#8212;in a beggarly way, as if one were
buying a flask of oil, and that not regularly? Or how compel the
Princeps to pay the ancient covenanted sum to the Cornicularius of the
day, when he now scarcely remembered the bare name of that officer, as
he never condescended to be present in the court when promotions were
made from a lower grade to a higher? Bitterly do I regret that I was
so late in coming to perceive for what a paltry price I was rendering
my long services as assistant in the courts, receiving in fact nothing
therefrom as my own <i>solatium</i>. It serves me right, however, for
having chosen that line of employment, as I will explain, if the
reader will allow me to recount to him my career from its commencement
to the present time.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p><p>Lydus then goes on to describe his arrival at Constantinople (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
511), his intention to enter the <i>Scrinium Memoriae</i> (in which he
would have served under the Magister Officiorum), and his abandonment
of this intention upon the pressing entreaties of his countryman
Zoticus, who was at the time Praefectus Praetorio. This step Lydus
looks upon as the fatal mistake of his life, though the consequences
of it to him were in some degree mitigated by the marriage which
Zoticus enabled him to make with a lady possessed of a fortune of 100
pounds' weight of gold (&#163;4,000). Her property, her virtues (for 'she
was superior to all women who have ever been admired for their moral
excellence'), and the consolations of Philosophy and Literature, did
much to soothe the disappointment of Lydus, who nevertheless felt,
when he retired to his books after forty years of service, in which he
had reached the unrewarded post of Cornicularius, that his official
life had been a failure.</p>

<p>It has seemed worth while to give this sketch of the actual career of
a Byzantine official, as it may illustrate in some points the lives of
the functionaries to whom so many of the letters of Cassiodorus are
addressed; though I know not whether we have any indications of such a
rivalry at Ravenna as that which prevailed at Constantinople between
the <i>officium</i> of the Praefect and that of the Magister. We now pass
on to</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adjutor.</div>

<p>(3) The <i>Adjutor</i>. Some of the uses of this term are very perplexing.
It seems clear (from Lydus, 'De Mag.' iii. 3) that all the members of
the officium were known by the generic name <i>Adjutores</i>. Here however
we may perhaps safely assume that Adjutor means simply an assistant to
the officer next above him, as we find, lower down in the list of the
'Notitia,' the Exceptores followed by their Adjutores. We may find a
parallel to Adjutor in the word Lieutenant, which, for the same reason
is applied to officers of such different rank as the Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland, a Lieutenant-General,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> a Lieutenant-Colonel, and a simple
Lieutenant in the Army or Navy. <span class="sidenote">Primiscrinius.</span>In the lists of Cassiodorus and Lydus
we find no mention of an officer bearing the special name of Adjutor,
but we meet instead with a <i>Primiscrinius</i>, of whom, according to
Lydus, there were two. He says<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>, 'After the Cornicularius are two
Primiscrinii, whom the Greeks call first of the service<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.' And
later on<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>, when he is describing the course of business in the
<i>secretum</i> of the Praefect, as it used to be in the good old days, he
informs us that after judgment had been given, and the Secretarii had
read to the litigant the decree prepared by the Assessors and
carefully copied by one of the Cancellarii, and after an accurate
digest of the case had been prepared in the Latin language by a
Secretarius, in order to guard against future error or
misrepresentation, the successful litigant passed on with the decree
in his hand <i>to the Primiscrinii, who appointed an officer to execute
the judgment of the Court</i><a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. These men then put the decree into
its final shape by means of the persons appointed to assist them<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
(men who could puzzle even the professors themselves in logical
discussions), and endorsed it on the litigant's petition in characters
which at once struck awe into the reader, and which seemed actually
swollen with official importance<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. The name and titles of the
'completing' officer were then subscribed.</p>

<p>If the suggestion that the Primiscrinii were considered as in some
sense substitutes (Adjutores) for the Cornicularius be correct, we may
perhaps account for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> being two of them in the days of Lydus by
the disappearance of the Princeps. The office of Cornicularius had
swallowed up that of Princeps, and accordingly the single Adjutor, who
was sufficient at the compilation of the 'Notitia,' had to be
multiplied by two.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commentariensis, or Commentarisius.</div>

<p>(4) The <i>Commentariensis</i>. Here we come again to an officer who is
mentioned by all our three authorities, though in Cassiodorus he seems
to be degraded some steps below his proper rank (but this may only be
from an accidental transposition of the order of the letters), and
though Lydus again gives us two of the name instead of one. The
last-named authority inserts next after the Primiscrinii 'two
Commentarisii&#8212;so the law calls those who are appointed to attend to
the drawing up of indictments<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.'</p>

<p>The Commentariensis (or Commentarisius, as Lydus calls him<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>) was
evidently the chief assistant of the Judge in all matters of criminal
jurisdiction<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. We have a remarkably full, and in the main clear
account of his functions in the pages of Lydus (iii. 16-18), from
which it appears that he was promoted from the ranks of the
<i>Exceptores</i> (shorthand writers), and had six of his former colleagues
serving under him as Adjutores<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. Great was the power, and high the
position in the Civil Service, of the Commentariensis. The whole tribe
of process-servers, gaolers, lictors<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>&#8212;all that we now understand
by the police force&#8212;waited subserviently on his nod. It rested with
him, says Lydus, to establish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> authority of the Court of Justice
by means of the wholesome fear inspired by iron chains and scourges
and the whole apparatus of torture<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. Nay, not only did the
subordinate magistrates execute their sentences by his agency, he had
even the honour of being chosen by the Emperor himself to be the
minister of vengeance against the persons who had incurred his anger
or his suspicion. 'I myself remember,' says Lydus, 'when I was serving
as Chartularius in the office of the Commentariensis, under the
praefecture of Leontius (a man of the highest legal eminence), and
when the wrath of Anastasius was kindled against Apion, a person of
the most exalted rank, and one who had assisted in his elevation to
the throne<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>, at the same time when Kobad, King of Persia, blazed
out into fury<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>, that then all the confiscations and banishments
which were ordered by the enraged Emperor were entrusted to no one
else but to the Commentarienses serving under the Praefect. In this
service they acquitted themselves so well, with such vigour, such
harmonious energy, such entire clean-handedness and absence of all
dishonest gain, as to move the admiration of the Emperor, who made use
of them on all similar occasions that presented themselves in the
remainder of his reign. They had even the honour of being employed
against Macedonius, Patriarch of Constantinople, when that prelate had
provoked the Emperor by suspending all intercourse with him as a
heretic; and that, although Celer, one of the most intimate friends of
Anastasius, was at that very time holding the rank of Magister
Officiorum.'</p>

<p>An officer who was thus privileged to lay hands on Patriarch and
Patrician in the name of Augustus was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> looked up to with awful
reverence by all the lower members of the official hierarchy; and
Lydus, with one graphic touch, brings before us the glow of gratified
self-love with which, when he was a subordinate <i>Scriniarius</i>, he
found himself honoured by the familiar conversation of so great a
person as the Commentariensis<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>: 'I too am struck with somewhat of
my old awe, recurring in memory to those who were then holders of the
office. I remember what fear of the Commentarisii fell upon all who at
all took the lead in the <i>Officium</i>, but especially on the Scriniarii;
and how greatly he who was favoured with a chat with a Commentarisius
passing by valued himself on the honour.' Lydus also describes to us
how the Commentariensis, instructed by the Praefect, or perhaps even
by the Emperor himself, would take with him one of his faithful
servants, the Chartularii, would visit the abode of the suspected
person (who might, as we have seen, be one of the very highest
officers of the State), and would then in his presence dictate in
solemn Latin words the indictment which was to be laid against him,
the mere hearing of which sometimes brought the criminal to confess
his guilt and throw himself on the mercy of the Emperor.</p>

<p>It was from this <i>commentum</i>, the equivalent of a French <i>acte
d'accusation</i>, that the Commentariensis derived his title.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ab Actis (Scriniarius Actorum?).</div>

<p>(5) The <i>Ab Actis</i>. The officer who bore this title (which is perhaps
the same as the Scriniarius Actorum of Cassiodorus<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>) seems to have
been exclusively concerned with civil cases, and perhaps held the same
place in reference to them that the Commentarienses held in criminal
matters<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. Practically, his office appears to have been very much
what we understand by that of <i>Chief Registrar</i> of the Court. He (or
they, for in Lydus'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> time there were two <i>Ab Actis</i> as well as two
Commentarienses<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>) was chosen from the select body of shorthand
writers who were known as Augustales, and was assisted by six men of
the same class, 'men of high character and intelligence and still in
the vigour of their years<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>.' His chief business&#8212;and in this he
was served by the <i>Nomenclatores</i>, who shouted out in a loud voice the
names of the litigants&#8212;was to introduce the plaintiff and defendant
into the Court, or to make a brief statement of the nature of the case
to the presiding magistrate. He then had to watch the course of the
pleadings and listen to the Judge's decision, so as to be able to
prepare a full statement of the case for the Registers or
Journals<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> of the Court. These Registers&#8212;at least in the
flourishing days of Roman jurisprudence&#8212;were most fully and
accurately kept. Even the <i>Dies Nefasti</i> were marked upon them, and
the reason for their being observed as legal holidays duly noted.
Elaborate indices, prepared by the Chartularii, made search an easy
matter to those who wished to ascertain what was the decision of the
law upon every point; and the marginal notes, or <i>personalia</i>,
prepared in Latin<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> by the Ab Actis or his assistants, were so
excellent and so full that sometimes when the original entry in the
Registers had been lost the whole case could be sufficiently
reconstructed from them alone.</p>

<p>The question was already mooted at Constantinople in the sixth century
whence the Ab Actis derived his somewhat elliptical name; and our
archaeology-loving scribe was able to inform his readers that as the
officer of the household who was called <i>A Pigmentis</i> had the care of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the aromatic ointments of the Court; as the <i>A Sabanis</i><a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> had
charge of the bathing towels of the baths; as the <i>A Secretis</i> (who
was called Ad Secretis by vulgar Byzantines, ignorant of the niceties
of Latin grammar) was concerned in keeping the secret counsels of his
Sovereign: so the <i>Ab Actis</i> derived his title from the Acts of the
Court which it was his duty to keep duly posted up and properly
indexed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Numerarii.</div>

<p>(6) The <i>Numerarii</i> (whose exact number is not stated in the
'Notitia'<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>) were the cashiers of the Praefect's office. Though
frequently mentioned in the Theodosian Code, and though persons
exercising this function must always have existed in a great Court of
Justice like the Praefect's, we hear but little of them from
Cassiodorus<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>; and Lydus' notices of the <span lang="el" title="Greek: diapsêphistai">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#968;&#951;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>,
who seem to correspond to the Numerarii<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, are scanty and
imperfect. Our German commentator has collected the passages of the
Theodosian Code which relate to this class of officers, and has shown
that on account of their rapacity and extortion their office was
subjected to a continual process of degradation. All the Numerarii,
except those of the two highest classes of judges<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>, were degraded
into <i>Tabularii</i>, a name which had previously indicated the cashiers
of a municipality as distinguished from those in the Imperial service;
and the Numerarii, even of the Praetorian Praefect himself, were made
subject to examination by torture. This was not only to be dreaded on
account of the bodily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> suffering which it inflicted, but was also a
mark of the humble condition of those to whom it was applied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scriniarius Curae Militaris.</div>

<p>We may perhaps see in the <i>Scriniarius Curae Militaris</i> of
Cassiodorus<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> one of these Numerarii detailed for service as
paymaster to the soldiers who waited upon the orders of the Praefect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subadjuvae.</div>

<p>(7) The <i>Subadjuvae</i>. This is probably a somewhat vague term, like
Adjutores, and indicates a second and lower class of cashiers who
acted as deputies for the regular Numerarii.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cura Epistolarum.</div>

<p>(8) <i>Cura Epistolarum.</i> The officer who bore this title appears to
have had the duty of copying out all letters relating to fiscal
matters<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>. This theory as to his office is confirmed by the words
of Cassiodorus (Var. <a href="#xi23">xi. 23</a>): 'Let Constantinian on his promotion
receive the care of the letters relating to the land-tax' (Hic itaque
epistolarum <i>canonicarum</i> curam provectus accipiat).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Regerendarius, or Regendarius.</div>

<p>(9) <i>Regerendarius</i>, or <i>Regendarius</i><a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. This officer had the
charge of all contracts relating to the very important department of
the <i>Cursus Publicus</i>, or Imperial Mail Service. At the time of the
compilation of the 'Notitia' only one person appears to have acted in
this capacity under each Praefect. When Lydus wrote, there were two
Regendarii in each Praefecture, but, owing to the increasing influence
of the Magister Officiorum over the Cursus Publicus<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>, their office
had become apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> little more than an ill-paid sinecure. As we
hear nothing of similar changes in the West, the Cursus Publicus was
probably a part of the public service which was directly under the
control of Cassiodorus when Praetorian Praefect, and was administered
at his bidding by one or more Regendarii.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exceptores.</div>

<p>(10) We now come to the <i>Exceptores</i>, or shorthand writers<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>, a
large and fluctuating body who stood on the lowest step of the
official ladder<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and formed the raw material out of which all its
higher functionaries were fashioned in the regular order of promotion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Augustales.</div>

<p>We are informed by Lydus<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>, that in his time the Exceptores in the
Eastern Empire were divided into two corps, the higher one called
<i>Augustales</i>, who were limited in number to thirty, and the lower, of
indefinite number and composing the rank and file of the profession.
The Augustales only could aspire to the rank of Cornicularius; but in
order that some prizes might still be left of possible attainment by
the larger class, the rank of Primiscrinius was tenable by those who
remained 'on the rolls of the Exceptores.' The reason for this change
was that the unchecked application of the principle of seniority to so
large a body of public servants was throwing all the more important
offices in the Courts of Justice into the hands of old men. The
principle of 'seniority tempered by selection' was therefore
introduced, and the ablest and most learned members of the class of
Exceptores were drafted off into this favoured section of Augustales,
fifteen of the most experienced of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> whom were appropriated to the
special service of the Emperor, while the other fifteen filled the
higher offices (with the exception of the Primiscriniate) in the
Praefectoral Courts<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. <span class="sidenote">Deputati.</span>The first fifteen were called
<i>Deputati</i><a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>, the others were apparently known simply as
Augustales.</p>

<p>The change thus described by Lydus appears to have been made in the
West as well as in the East, since we hear in the 'Variae' of
Cassiodorus (<a href="#xi30">xi. 30</a>) of the appointment of a certain Ursus to be
Primicerius of the Deputati, and of Beatus to take the same place
among the Augustales<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adjutores.</div>

<p>(11) The <i>Adjutores</i> of the 'Notitia' were probably a lower class of
Exceptores, who may very likely have disappeared when the Augustales
were formed out of them by the process of differentiation which has
been described above.</p>

<p>We have now gone through the whole of what was termed the 'Learned
Service<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>' mentioned in the 'Notitia,' with one exception&#8212;the
title of an officer, in himself humble and obscure, who has given his
name to the highest functionaries of mediaeval and modern Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cancellarius.</div>

<p>(12) The <i>Cancellarius</i> appears in the 'Notitia' only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> once<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>, and
then in connection not with the Praetorian Praefect, but with the
Master of the Offices. At the very end of the Officium of this
dignitary, after the six <i>Scholae</i> and four <i>Scrinia</i> of his
subordinates, and after the <i>Admissionales</i>, whom we must look upon as
the Ushers of the Court, comes the entry,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Cancellarii:</p></div>

<p>their very number not stated, the office being too obscure to make a
few less or more a matter of importance.</p>

<p>After the compilation of the 'Notitia' the office of Cancellarius
apparently rose somewhat in importance, and was introduced into other
departments besides that of the Master of the Offices.</p>

<p>One Cancellarius appears attached to the Court of Cassiodorus as
Praetorian Praefect, and from the admonitions addressed to him by his
master<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>, we see that he had it in his power considerably to aid
the administration of justice by his integrity, or to hinder it by
showing himself accessible to bribes.</p>

<p>In describing the Cancellarius, as in almost every other part of his
treatise, Lydus has to tell a dismal story of ruin and decay<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>:</p>

<p>'Now the Scriniarii [subordinates of the Magister Officiorum] are made
Cancellarii and Logothetes and purveyors of the Imperial table,
whereas in old time the Cancellarius was chosen only from the ranks of
Augustales and Exceptores who had served with credit. In those days
the Judgment Hall [of the Praefect] recognised only two Cancellarii,
who received an <i>aureus</i> apiece<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> per day from the Treasury. There
was aforetime in the Court of Justice a fence separating the
Magistrate from his subordinates, and this fence, being made of long
splinters of wood placed diagonally, was called <i>cancellus</i>, from its
likeness to network, the regular Latin word for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> a net being casses,
and the diminutive cancellus<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>. At this latticed barrier then stood
two <i>Cancellarii</i>, by whom, since no one was allowed to approach the
judgment-seat, paper was brought to the members of the staff and
needful messages were delivered. But now that the office owing to the
number of its holders<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> has fallen into disrepute, and that the
Treasury no longer makes a special provision for their maintenance,
almost all the hangers-on of the Courts of Law call themselves
Cancellarii; and, not only in the capital but in the Provinces, they
give themselves this title in order that they may be able more
effectually to plunder the wealthy.'</p>

<p>This description by Lydus, while it aptly illustrates Cassiodorus'
exhortations to his Cancellarii to keep their hands clean from bribes,
shows how lowly their office was still considered; and indeed, but for
his statement that it used to be filled by veteran Augustales, we
might almost have doubted whether it is rightly classed among the
'Learned Services' at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">End of the Militia Literata.</div>

<p>Now at any rate we leave the ranks of the gentlemen of the Civil
Service behind us, and come to the 'Militia Illiterata,' of whom the
'Notitia' enumerates only</p>

<div class="sidenote">Militia Illiterata: Singularii.</div>

<p>(13) The <i>Singularii</i>, a class of men of whose useful services Lydus
speaks in terms of high praise, contrasting their modest efficiency
with the pompous verbosity<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> of the Magistriani (servants of the
Master of the Offices) by whom they were being generally superseded in
his day. They travelled through the Provinces, carrying the Praefect's
orders, and riding in a post-chaise drawn by a single horse (veredus),
from which circumstance, according to Lydus, they derived their name
Singularii<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p><p>We observe that the letter of Cassiodorus<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> addressed to the
retiring chief (Primicerius) of the Singularii informs him that he is
promoted to a place among the King's Body-guard (Domestici et
Protectores), a suitable reward for one who had not been a member of
the 'Learned Services.'</p>

<p>After the Singularii Lydus mentions the <i>Mancipes</i>, the men who were
either actually slaves or were at any rate engaged in servile
occupations; as, for instance, the bakers at the public bakeries, the
<i>Rationalii</i>, who distributed the rations to the receivers of the
annona<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>, the <i>Applicitarii</i> (officers of arrest), and
<i>Clavicularii</i> (gaolers), who, as we before heard, obeyed the mandate
of the Commentariensis. The Lictors, I think, are not mentioned by
him. A corresponding class of men would probably be the <i>Apparitores</i>,
who in the 'Notitia' appear almost exclusively attached to the service
of the great Ministers of War<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, it will be seen, from the well-paid and often highly-connected
Princeps, who, no doubt, discussed the business of the court with the
Praetorian Praefect on terms of friendly though respectful
familiarity, down to the gaoler and the lictor and the lowest of the
half-servile <i>mancipes</i>, there was a regular gradation of rank, which
still preserved, in the staff of the highest court of justice in the
land, all the traditions of subordination and discipline which had
once characterised the military organisation out of which it
originally sprang.</p>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHY.</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Editiones Principes.</div>

<p>The Ecclesiastical History ('Historia Tripartita') seems to have been
the first of the works of Cassiodorus to attract the notice of
printers at the revival of learning. The Editio Princeps of this book
(folio) was printed by Johann Schuszler, at Augsburg, in 1472<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>.</p>

<p>The Editio Princeps of the 'Chronicon' is contained in a collection of
Chronicles published at Basel in 1529 by Joannes Sichardus (printer,
Henricus Petrus). The contribution of Cassiodorus is prefaced by an
appropriate Epistle Dedicatory to Sir Thos. More, in which a parallel
is suggested between the lives of these two literary statesmen.</p>

<p>Next followed the Editio Princeps of the 'Variae,' published at
Augsburg in 1533, by Mariangelus Accurtius.</p>

<p>In 1553, Joannes Cuspinianus, a counsellor of the Emperor Maximilian,
published at Basel a series of Chronicles with which he interwove the
Chronicle of Cassiodorus, and to which he prefixed a short life of our
author.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edition of Nivellius.</div>

<p>The Editio Princeps of the collected works of Cassiodorus was
published at Paris in 1579 by Sebastianus Nivellius; and other
editions by the same publisher followed in 1584 and 1589. This edition
does not contain the Tripartite History, the Exposition of the
Psalter, or the 'Complexiones' on the Epistles. Some notes, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
without merit, are added, which were compiled in 1578 by 'Gulielmus
Fornerius, Parisiensis, Regius apud Aurelianenses Consiliarius et
Antecessor.' The annotator says<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> that these notes had gradually
accumulated on the margin of his copy of Cassiodorus, an author who
had been a favourite of his from youth, and whom he had often quoted
in his forensic speeches.</p>

<p>The edition of Nivellius, which is evidently prepared with a view to
aid the historical rather than the theological study of the writings
of Cassiodorus, contains also the Gothic history of Jordanus (sic),
the 'Edictum Theoderici,' the letter of Sidonius describing the Court
of Theodoric II <i>the Visigoth</i> (453-466), and the Panegyric of
Ennodius on Theodoric the Great. The letter of Sidonius is evidently
inserted owing to a confusion between the two Theodorics; and this
error has led many later commentators astray. But the reprint of the
'Edictum Theoderici' is of great interest and value, because the MS.
from which it was taken has since disappeared, and none other is known
to be in existence. A letter is prefixed to the 'Edictum,' written by
Pierre Pithou to Edouard Mol&#233;, Dec. 31, 1578, and describing his
reasons for sending this document to the publisher who was printing
the works of Cassiodorus. At the same time, 'that the West might not
have cause to envy the East,' he sent a MS. of the 'Leges
Wisigothorum,' with illustrative extracts from Isidore and Procopius,
which is printed at the end of Nivellius' edition.</p>

<p>I express no opinion about the text of this edition; but it possesses
the advantage of an Index to the 'Variae' only, which will be found at
the end of the Panegyric of Ennodius. Garet's Index, which is in
itself not so full, has the additional disadvantage of being muddled
up with the utterly alien matter of the Tripartite History.</p>

<p>In 1588 appeared an edition in 4to. of the works of Cassiodorus (still
excluding the Tripartite History and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> the Biblical Commentaries),
published at Paris by Marc Orry. This was republished in 1600 in two
volumes 12mo.</p>

<p>The 'Variae' and 'Chronicon' only, in 12mo. were published at Lyons by
Jacques Chouet in 1595, and again by Pierre and Jacques Chouet at
Geneva in 1609, and by their successors in 1650. These editions
contain the notes of Pierre Brosse, Jurisconsult, as well as those of
Fornerius.</p>

<p>In 1679 appeared, in two volumes folio, the great Rouen edition by
Fran&#231;ois Jean Garet (of the Congregation of S. Maur), which has ever
since been the standard edition of the works of Cassiodorus. Garet
speaks of collating several MSS. of various ages for the text of this
edition, especially mentioning 'Codex S. Audoeni' (deficient for Books
<a href="#BOOK_V">5</a>, <a href="#BOOK_VI">6</a>, and <a href="#BOOK_VII">7</a> of the 'Variae'), 'et antiquissimae membranae S. Remigii
Remensis' (containing only the first four books of the same
collection). A codex which once belonged to the jurist Cujacius, and
which had been collated with Accurtius' text in 1575 by a certain
Claude Grulart, seems to have given Garet some valuable readings by
means of Grulart's notes, though the codex itself had disappeared.
Garet's edition was re-issued at Venice in 1729, and more recently in
Migne's 'Patrologia' (Paris, 1865), of which it forms vols. 69 and 70.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forthcoming Edition by Meyer.</div>

<p>There can be little doubt, however, that all these editions will be
rendered obsolete by the new edition which is expected to appear as a
volume of the 'Auctores Antiquissimi' in the <i>Monumenta Germaniae
Historica</i>. The editor is Professor Wilhelm Meyer, of Munich. The work
has been for some years announced as near completion, but I have not
been able to ascertain how soon it may be expected to appear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Supposed fragment of orations.</div>

<p>Finally, I must not omit to notice the fragments of an oration
published by Baudi de Vesme in the Transactions of the Royal Academy
of Sciences at Turin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> (1846). Those fragments, which were found in a
palimpsest MS. of the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, were first
published in 1822 by Angelo Mai, who was then disposed to attribute
them to Symmachus (the elder), and to assign them to the early part of
the fifth century. On reflection, however, he came to the conclusion
that they were probably the work of Cassiodorus, and formed part of a
panegyric addressed to Theodoric. This theory appears now to meet with
general approval. The style is certainly very similar to that of
Cassiodorus; but, as will be inferred from the doubt as to their
origin, there is little or nothing in these scanty fragments which
adds anything to our knowledge of the history of Theodoric.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life by Garet.</div>

<p>To the literature relating to Cassiodorus the most important
contribution till recent times was the life by Garet prefixed to his
edition of 1679. I cannot speak of this from a very minute
investigation, but it seems to be a creditable performance, the work
of one who had carefully studied the 'Variae,' but unfortunately quite
misleading as to the whole framework of the life of Cassiodorus, from
the confusion which it makes between him and his father, an error
which Garet has probably done more than any other author to
perpetuate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life by St. Marthe.</div>

<p>The life by Garet was paraphrased in French by Denys de <i>Ste. Marthe</i>
('Vie de Cassiodore,' Paris, 1695), whose work has enjoyed a
reputation to which it was not entitled on the ground either of
originality or accuracy, but which was probably due to the fact that
the handy octavo volume written in French was accessible to a wider
circle of readers than Garet's unwieldy folio in Latin. A more
original performance was that of <i>Count Buat</i> (in the 'Abhandlungen
der Kurf&#252;rstlichen Bairischen Akademie der Wissenschaften,' Munich,
1763); but this author, though he pointed out the cardinal error of
Garet, his confusion between Senator and his father, introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> some
further gratuitous entanglements of his own into the family history of
the Cassiodori.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern monographs.</div>

<p>All these works, however, are rendered entirely obsolete by three
excellent monographs which have recently been published in Germany on
the life and writings of Cassiodorus. These are&#8212;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thorbecke.</div>

<p>August <i>Thorbecke's</i> 'Cassiodorus Senator' (Heidelberg, 1867);</p>

<div class="sidenote">Franz.</div>

<p>Adolph <i>Franz's</i> 'M. Aurelius Cassiodorius Senator' (Breslau, 1872);
and</p>

<div class="sidenote">Usener.</div>

<p>Hermann <i>Usener's</i> 'Anecdoton Holderi' (Bonn, 1877), described in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_II">second chapter</a> of this introduction.</p>

<p>Thorbecke discusses the political, and Franz the religious and
literary aspects of the life of their common hero, and between them
they leave no point of importance in obscurity. Usener, as we have
already seen, brings an important contribution to our knowledge of the
subject in presenting us with Holder's fragment; and his Commentary
(of eighty pages) on this fragment is a model of patient and
exhaustive research. It seems probable that these three authors have
really said pretty nearly the last word about the life and writings of
Cassiodorus. In addition to these authors many writers of historical
works in Germany have of late years incidentally contributed to a more
accurate understanding of the life and times of Cassiodorus.</p>

<p><i>Dahn</i>, in the third section of his 'K&#246;nige der Germanen' (W&#252;rzburg,
1866), has written a treatise on the political system of the
Ostrogoths which is almost a continuous commentary on the 'Variae,'
and from which I have derived the greatest possible assistance.</p>

<p><i>K&#246;pke</i>, in his 'Anf&#228;nge des K&#246;nigthums bei den Gothen' (Berlin,
1859), has condensed into a small compass a large amount of useful
disquisition on Cassiodorus and his copyist Jordanes. The relation
between these two writers was also elaborately discussed by <i>von
Sybel</i> in his thesis 'De Fontibus Libri Jordanis' (Berlin, 1838),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> and
by <i>Schirren</i>, in his monograph 'De Ratione quae inter Jordanem et
Cassiodorum intercedat' (Dorpat, 1885). The latter, though upon the
whole a creditable performance, is disfigured by one or two strange
blunders, and not improved by some displays of irrelevant learning.</p>

<p><i>Von Schubert</i>, in his 'Unterwerfung der Alamannen unter die Franken'
(Strassburg, 1884), throws some useful light on the question of the
date of the early letters in the 'Variae;' and <i>Binding</i>, in his
'Geschichte des Burgundisch-Romanischen K&#246;nigreichs' (Leipzig, 1868),
discusses the relations between Theodoric and the Sovereigns of Gaul,
as disclosed by the same collection of letters, in a manner which I
must admit to be forcible, though I do not accept all his conclusions.</p>

<p><i>Mommsen</i>, in his paper 'Die Chronik des Cassiodorus Senator' (Vol.
viii. of the 'Abhandlungen der K&#246;niglich S&#228;chsischen Gesellschaft der
Wissenschaften;' Leipzig, 1861), has said all that is to be said
concerning the unfortunate 'Chronicon' of Cassiodorus, which he
handles with merciless severity.</p>

<p>To say that <i>Ebert</i>, in his 'Allgemeine Geschichte der Litteratur des
Mittelalters im Abendlande' (Leipzig, 1874), and <i>Wattenbach</i>, in his
'Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen im Mittelalter,' tell us with fullness
and accuracy just what the student ought to wish to know concerning
Cassiodorus as an author, is only to say that they are Ebert and
Wattenbach. Every one who has had occasion to refer to these two books
knows their merits.</p>

<p>Passing from German literature, I regret that I am prevented by
ignorance of the Dutch language from forming an opinion as to the work
of <i>Thijm</i> ('Iets over M.A. Cassiodorus en zijne eeuw;' Amsterdam,
1857), which is frequently quoted by my German authorities.</p>

<p><i>Gibbon</i> of course quotes from the 'Variae,' and though he did not
know them intimately, he has with his usual sagacity apprehended the
true character of the book and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> its author. But the best account of
the 'Various Letters' in English, as far as I know, is unfortunately
entombed in the pages of a periodical, being an article by Dean
<i>Church</i>, contributed in July, 1880, to the 'Church Quarterly Review.'
There is also a very good though necessarily brief notice of
Cassiodorus in <i>Ugo Balzani's</i> little volume on the 'Early Chroniclers
of Italy,' published by the Christian Knowledge Society in 1883.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>CHRONOLOGY.</h3>


<p>In the following chronological table of the life of Cassiodorus I
have, for convenience sake, assumed 480 as the year of his birth, and
575 as that of his death. It is now, I think, sufficiently proved that
if these dates are not absolutely correct, they cannot be more than a
year or two wrong in one direction or the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consular Fasti.</div>

<p>As dates were still reckoned by Consulships, at any rate through the
greater part of the life of Cassiodorus, I have inserted the Consular
Fasti for the period in question. It will be seen that several names
of correspondents of Cassiodorus figure in this list. As a general
though not universal practice, one of the two Consuls at this time was
chosen from out of the Senate of Rome and the other from that of
Constantinople. We can almost always tell whether a chronicler belongs
to the Eastern or Western Empire by observing whether he puts the
Eastern or Western Consul first. Thus, for <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 501, Marcellinus
Comes, who was an official of the Eastern Empire, gives us 'Pompeius
et Avienus, Coss.;' while Cassiodorus, in his 'Chronicon,' assigns the
year to 'Avienus et Pompeius.' Pompeius was a nobleman of
Constantinople, nephew of the Emperor Anastasius; while Avienus was a
Roman Senator<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>. Again, in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 490, Marcellinus gives the names of
Longinus and Faustus, which Cassiodorus quotes as Faustus and
Longinus. Longinus was a brother of the Emperor Zeno, and Faustus was
for many years Praetorian Praefect under Theodoric, and was the
receiver of many letters in the following collection.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>I have endeavoured to give the priority always to the <i>Western</i> Consul
in the list before us, except in those cases where an Emperor (who was
of course an Eastern) condescended to assume the Consular <i>trabea</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indictions.</div>

<p>Another mode of reckoning the dates which the reader will continually
meet with in the following pages is by <i>Indictions</i>. The Indiction, as
is well known, was a cycle of fifteen years, during which, as we have
reason to believe, the assessment for the taxes remained undisturbed,
a fresh valuation being made all round when the cycle was ended.
Traces of this quindecennial period may be found in the third century,
but the formal adoption of the Indiction is generally assigned to the
Emperor Constantine, and to the year 312<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>. The Indiction itself,
and every one of the years composing it, began on the 1st of September
of the calendar year. The reason for this period being chosen probably
was that the harvests of the year being then gathered in, the
collection of the tithes of the produce, which formed an important
part of the Imperial revenue, could be at once proceeded with. What
gives an especial importance to this method of dating by Indictions,
for the reader of the following letters is, that most of the great
offices of State changed hands at the beginning of the year of the
Indiction (Sept. 1), not at the beginning of the Calendar year.</p>

<p>To make such a mode of dating the year at all satisfactory, it would
seem to us necessary that the number of the cycle itself, as well as
of the year in the cycle, should be given; for instance, that <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 313
should be called the first year of the first Indiction, and <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 351
the ninth year of the third Indiction. This practice, however, was not
adopted till far on into the Middle Ages<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. At the time we are
speaking of, the word Indic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>tion seems generally to have been given
not to the cycle itself, but to the year in the cycle. Thus, 313 was
the first Indiction, 314 the second Indiction, 315 the third
Indiction, and so on. And thus we find a year, which from other
sources we know to be 313, called the first Indiction, 351 the ninth
Indiction, 537 the fifteenth Indiction, without any clue being given
to guide us to the important point in what cycles these years held
respectively the first, the ninth, and the fifteenth places.</p>

<p>As the Indiction began on the 1st of September a question arises
whether the calendar year is to be named after the number of the
Indiction which belongs to its beginning or its end; whether, to go
back to the beginning, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 312 or <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 313 is to be accounted the
first Indiction. The practice of the chroniclers and of most writers
on chronology appears to be in favour of the latter method, which is
natural, inasmuch as nine months of the Indiction belong to the later
date and only three to the earlier. Thus, for instance, Marcellinus
Comes calls the year of the Consulship of Belisarius, which was
undoubtedly 535, 'Indictio XIII:' the thirteenth Indiction of that
cycle having begun Sept. 1, 534, and ended August 31, 535. But it is
well that the student should be warned that our greatest English
authority, Mr. Fynes Clinton, adopts the other method. In the very
useful table of comparative chronology which he gives in his Fasti
Romani<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> he assigns the Indiction to that year of the Christian era
in which it had its beginning, and accordingly 534, not 535, is
identified with the thirteenth Indiction.</p>

<p>In order to translate years of Indiction into years of the Christian
era it is necessary first to add some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> multiple of 15 (<i>what</i> multiple
our knowledge of history must inform us) to 312. On the 1st of
September of the year so obtained the Indiction cycle began; and for
any other year of the same cycle we must of course add its own number
minus one. Thus, when we find Cassiodorus as Praetorian Praefect
writing a letter<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> informing Joannes of his appointment to the
office of Cancellarius 'for the <i>twelfth</i> Indiction,' as we know
within a little what date is wanted, we first of all add 14 x 15 (=
210) to 312, and so obtain 522. The first Indiction in that cycle ran
from September 1, 522, to August 31, 523. The twelfth Indiction was
therefore from September 1, 533, to August 31, 534, and that is the
date we require.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when we find a letter written by Cassiodorus as
Praetorian Praefect to the Provincials of Istria<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> as to the
payment of tribute for the <i>first</i> Indiction, we know that we must now
have entered upon a new cycle. We therefore add 15 x 15 (= 225) to
312, and get 537. As it happens to be the <i>first</i> Indiction that we
require, our calculation ends here: September 1, 537, to August 31,
538, is the answer required.</p>

<p>If anyone objects that such a system of chronology is cumbrous,
uncertain, and utterly unscientific, I can only say that I entirely
agree with him, and that the system is worthy of the perverted
ingenuity which produced the Nones and Ides of the Roman Calendar.</p>

<p>In the following tables I have not attempted to mark the years of the
Indiction, on account of the confusion caused by the fact that two
calendar years require the same number. But I have denoted by the
abbreviation 'Ind.' the years in which each cycle of the Indictions
<i>began</i>. These years are 492, 507, 522, 537, 552, and 567.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason for publication: entreaties of friends.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Learned</span> men, who had become my friends through conversations which we
had had together, or benefits which I had bestowed upon them, sought
to persuade me to draw together into one work the various utterances
which it had been my duty to make, during my tenure of office, for the
explanation of different affairs. They desired me to do this, in order
that future generations might recognise the painful labours which I
had undergone for the public good, and the workings of my own unbribed
conscience. I then replied that their very kindness for me might turn
out to my disadvantage, since the letters which their good-will found
acceptable might to future readers seem insipid. I reminded them also
of the words of Horace, warning us of the dangers of hasty
publication.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty of writing.</div>

<p>'You see,' said I, 'that all require from me a speedy reply to their
petitions; and do you think that I couch those replies in words which
leave me nothing to regret hereafter? Our diction must be somewhat
rude when there is no sufficient delay to enable the speaker to choose
words which shall rightly express the precise shade of his meaning.
Speech is the common gift of all mankind: it is embellishment
(ornatus) alone which distinguishes between the learned and unlearned.
The author is told to keep his writings by him for nine years for
reflection; but I have not as many hours, hardly as many moments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> As
soon as I begin the petitioner worries me with his clamours, and
hurries me too much to prevent my finishing cautiously, even if I have
so begun my task. One vexes me past endurance by his interruptions and
innuendoes; another torments me with the doleful tale of his miseries;
others surround me with the mad shouts of their seditious
contentions<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>. In such circumstances how can you expect elegance of
language, when we have scarcely opportunity to put words together in
any fashion? Even at night indescribable cares are flitting round our
couch<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>, while we are harassed with fear lest the cities should
lack their supplies of food&#8212;food which the common people insist upon
more than anything else, caring more for their bellies than for the
gratification of their ears by eloquence. This thought obliges us to
wander in imagination through all the Provinces, and ever to enquire
after the execution of our orders, since it is not enough to tell our
staff what has to be done, but the diligent administrator must see
that it is done<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>. Therefore, I pray you, spare us your harmful
love. I must decline this persuasion of yours, which will bring me
more of danger than of glory.'</p>

<p>So I pleaded; but they plied me all the more with such arguments as
these:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Praefecture.</div>

<p>'All men have known you as Praefect of the Praetorian throne, a
dignity which all other public employments wait upon like lacqueys.
For from this high office, ways and means for the army are demanded;
from this, without any regard for the difficulty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> times, the
food of the people is required; on this, a weight of judicial
responsibility is thrown, which would be by itself a heavy burden. Now
the law, which has thrown this immense load on the Praefect's office,
has, on the other hand, honoured him by putting almost all things
under his control. In truth, what interval of leisure could you snatch
from your public labours, when into your single breast flowed every
claim which could be made on behalf of the common good of all?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Quaestorship.</div>

<p>'We must add, moreover, that when you were on frequent occasions
charged with the office of the Quaestorship, the leisure which you
might have enjoyed was taken from you by your own constant
thoughtfulness for the public good; and when you were thus bearing the
weight of an honour which was not the highest, your Sovereigns used to
lay upon you those duties, properly belonging to other offices, which
their own holders were unable to discharge<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>. All these duties you
discharged with absolute freedom from corruption, following your
father's example in receiving, from those who hoped for your favour,
nothing but the obligation to serve them, and bestowing on petitioners
all that they had a right to ask for without traffic or reward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intimacy with Theodoric.</div>

<p>'Moreover, men know that the conversations which you were honoured by
holding with the King occupied a large portion of your days, greatly
to the public welfare<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>, so that men of leisure have no right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> to
expect that their requirements shall be met by you, whose day was thus
occupied with continuous toil<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>. But in truth this will redound yet
more to your glory, if amid so many and such severe labours you
succeed in writing that which is worthy to be read. Besides, your work
can without wounding their self-love instruct unlettered persons who
are not prepared by any consciousness of eloquence for the service of
the Republic<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>; and the experience which you have gained by being
tossed to and fro on the waves of stormy altercation, they in their
more tranquil lot may more fortunately make their own. Again (and here
we make an appeal which your loyalty cannot resist), if you allow
posterity to be ignorant of the numerous benefits conferred by your
King, it is in vain that with benevolent eagerness he so often granted
your requests. Do not, we pray, draw back once more into silence and
obscurity those who, while you were sounding their eulogies, seemed
worthy to receive illustrious dignities. For you then professed to
describe them with true praises, and to paint their characters with
the colours of history<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>. Now if you leave it to posterity to write
the panegyric on these men, you take away as it were from those who
die an honourable death the funeral oration to which, by the customs
of our ancestors, they are entitled. Besides, in these letters you
correct immorality with a ruler's authority; you break the insolence
of the transgressor; you restore to the laws their reverence. Do you
still hesitate about publishing that which, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> know, satisfies so
many needs? Will you conceal, if we may say so, the mirror of your own
mind, in which all ages to come may behold your likeness? Often does
it happen that a man begets a son unlike himself, but his writings are
hardly ever found unequal to his character<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. The progeny of his
own will is his truest child; what is born in the secret recesses of
his own heart is that by which posterity will know him best.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gothic History.</div>

<p>'You have often, amid universal acclamation, pronounced the praises of
kings and queens. In twelve books you have compiled the History of the
Goths, culling the story of their triumphs<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>. Since these works
have had such favourable fortunes, and since you have thus served your
first campaign in literature, why hesitate to give these productions
of yours also to the public?'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cassiodorus consents to publish.</div>

<p>So pleaded my friends, and to my shame I must own that I was
conquered, and could no longer resist so many prayers; especially when
I saw myself accused of want of affection. I have now only to crave my
readers' pardon; and if they find rashness and presumption in my
attempt, to blame my advisers rather than me, since my own judgment
agrees with that of my severest critic.</p>

<p>All the letters, therefore, which I have been able to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> in various
public archives that had been dictated by me as Quaestor, as Magister
[Officiorum], or as Praefect, are here collected and arranged in
twelve books. By the variety of subjects touched upon, the attention
of the reader will be aroused, and it will be maintained by the
feeling that he is rapidly approaching the conclusion of the letter.</p>

<p>I have also wished to preserve others from those unpolished and hasty
forms of speech into which I am conscious that I have often fallen in
announcing the bestowal of dignities, a kind of document which is
often asked for in such haste that there seems scarce time for the
mere manual labour of writing it. I have therefore included in my
<a href="#BOOK_VI">Sixth</a> and <a href="#BOOK_VII">Seventh</a> Books <i>Formulae</i> for the granting of all the
dignities of the State, hoping thus to be of some service to myself,
though at a late period of my career, and to help my successors who
may be hard pressed for time. What I have thus written concerning the
past will serve equally well for the future, since I have said nothing
about the qualities of the individual office-holder, but have made
such explanations as seemed suitable concerning the office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason of the title Variarum.</div>

<p>As for the title of all twelve books, the index of the work, the
herald of its meaning, the expression in briefest compass of the whole
performance, I have for this chosen the name <span class="smcap">variae</span>. And this, because
it was necessary for me not always to use the same style, since I had
undertaken to address various kinds of persons. One must speak in one
way to men jaded with much reading; in another to those who skim
lightly over the surface, tasting here and there; in another (if one
would persuade them), to persons who are devoid of a taste for
letters, since it is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> a proof of skill to avoid the very
things which please the learned. In short, the definition given by our
ancestors is a good one: 'To speak fitly is to persuade the hearers to
accept your wishes for their own.' Nor was it at random that the
prudence of Antiquity thus defined the three modes of speaking:&#8212;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The three styles of composition.</div>

<p>(1) The <i>humble</i> style, which seems to creep along the ground in the
very expression of its thought.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>middle</i> style, which is neither swollen with self-importance
nor shrunk into littleness; but being placed between the two, and
enriched by a peculiar elegance, is contained within its own true
boundaries.</p>

<p>(3) The <i>supreme</i> style, which by exquisite phraseology is raised to
the very highest pitch of oratory.</p>

<p>The object of this distinction is that the various sorts and
conditions of men may each receive their appropriate address, and that
the thoughts which proceed from the same breast may nevertheless flow
in divers channels. No man is entitled to the name of eloquent who is
not prepared to do his duty manfully with the triple strength of these
three styles, as one cause after another may arise. It must be added
hereto that we have sometimes to speak to Kings, sometimes to the
Officers of the Court, sometimes to the very humblest of the people.
To the last we may allowably pour out our words with some degree of
haste, but the other addresses should be deeply pondered before they
are delivered. Deservedly therefore is a work entitled <span class="smcap">variae</span>, which
is subject to so much diversity in its composition.</p>

<p>Would that, as we have received these maxims from those who have gone
before us, so our own compositions could claim the praise of having
reduced them into practice. In sooth we do with shamefacedness
promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> that the Humble style shall be found in us; we think we may
without dishonesty covenant for the Middle style; but the Supreme
style, which on account of its nobility is the fitting language of a
royal Edict<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>, we cannot hope that we have attained unto.</p>

<p>But since we are to be read, let us abstain from further unlawful
canvassing for the votes of our readers. It is an incongruous thing
for us to be thus piling up our own discourses about ourselves: we
ought rather to wait for your judgment on our work.</p>

<h3><a name="i2">2.</a> <span class="smcap">King Theodoric to Theon, Vir Sublimis</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Manufacture of purple dye.</div>

<p>'We are informed by Count Stephen that the work of preparing the
purple for the sacred (<i>i.e.</i> royal) robes, which was put under your
charge, has been interrupted through reprehensible negligence on your
part. There must be neglect somewhere, or else the wool with its
milk-white hairs would long before now have imbibed the precious
quality of the adorable <i>murex</i>. If the diver in the waters of
Hydruntum<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> had sought for these murex-shells at the proper season,
that Neptunian harvest, mixed with an abundant supply of water, would
already have generated the flame-bright liquid which dyes the robes
that adorn the throne. The colour of that dye is gay<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> with too
great beauty; 'tis a blushing obscurity, an ensanguined blackness,
which distinguishes the wearer from all others, and makes it
impossible for the human race not to know who is the king. It is
marvellous that that substance after death should for so long a time
exude an amount of gore which one would hardly find flowing from the
wounds of a living creature. For even six months after they have been
separated from the delights of the sea, these shell-fish are not
offensive to the keenest nostrils, as if on purpose that that noble
blood might inspire no disgust. Once this dye is imparted to the
cloth, it remains there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> for ever; the tissue may be destroyed sooner
than part with it. If the murex has not changed its quality, if the
press (torcular) is still there to receive its one vintage, it must be
the fault of the labourers that the dye is not forthcoming. What are
they doing, all those crowds of sailors, those families of rustics?
And you who bear the name of Count, and were exalted high over your
fellow-citizens on purpose that you might attend to this very thing,
what sacrilegious negligence is this which you are manifesting in
reference to the sacred vesture? If you have any care for your own
safety come at once with the purple<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>, which you have hitherto been
accustomed to render up every year. If not, if you think to mock us by
delay, we shall send you not a constrainer but an avenger.</p>

<p>'How easy was the discovery of this great branch of manufacture! A
dog, keen with hunger, bounding along the Tyrian shore, crunched the
shells which were cast up there. The purple gore dyed his jaws with a
marvellous colour; and the men who saw it, after the sudden fashion of
inventors, conceived the idea of making therewith a noble adornment
for their kings. What Tyre is for the East, Hydron<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> is for

Valentinian III. This last was a great honour, for only men of
spotless life were associated with the Imperial 'Secretum.' A
friendship, founded on likeness, drew him to the side of Aetius, whose
labours for the State he shared.</p>

<p><i>Embassy to Attila.</i> 'With the son of this Aetius, named Carpilio, he
was sent on no vain embassy to Attila, the mighty in arms. He looked
undaunted on the man before whom the Empire quailed. Calm in conscious
strength, he despised all those terrible wrathful faces that scowled
around him. He did not hesitate to meet the full force of the
invectives of the madman who fancied himself about to grasp the Empire
of the world. He found the King insolent; he left him pacified; and so
ably did he argue down all his slanderous pretexts for dispute that
though the Hun's interest was to quarrel with the richest Empire in
the world, he nevertheless condescended to seek its favour. The
firmness of the orator roused the fainting courage of his countrymen,
and men felt that Rome could not be pronounced defenceless while she
was armed with such ambassadors. Thus did he bring back the peace
which men had despaired of; and as earnestly as they had prayed for
his success, so thankfully did they welcome his return.'</p>

<p>He was offered honours and revenues, but preferred to seek the
pleasant retirement of Bruttii in the land which his exertions had
freed from the terror of the stranger.</p>

<p>His father, Cassiodorus<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>, an 'Illustris,' defended the coasts of
Sicily and Bruttii from the Vandals, thus averting from those regions
the ruin which afterwards fell upon Rome from the same quarter.</p>

<p>In the East, Heliodorus, a cousin of the Cassiodori, has brilliantly
discharged the office of Praefect for <b><a href="#err6">eighteen</a></b> years, as Theodoric
himself can testify. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> the family, conspicuous both in the Eastern
and Western World, has two eyes with which it shines with equal
brilliancy in each Senate.</p>

<p>Cassiodorus is so wealthy that his herds of horses surpass those of
the King, to whom he makes presents of some of them in order to avoid
envy. 'Hence it arises that our present candidate [for patrician
honours] mounts the armies of the Goths; and having even improved upon
his education, generously administers the wealth which he received
from his parents.</p>

<p>Apparently Felix is accused by Venantius, the guardian of his young
brother-in-law Plutianus, of having, on behalf of his wife, made an
unfair division of the family property (which had been originally
given to the father of these lads by Theodoric, as a reward for his
services). In doing this he has availed himself of the spendthrift
character of Neotherius, the elder brother, who was probably already
of age.</p>

<p>Felix is severely blamed, and ordered to hand over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> what he has
fraudulently appropriated to the official, who is charged with the

<p>(1) Some sublime reflections in the true Cassiodorian vein on the
nature of Arithmetic, by which earth and the heavens are ruled.</p>

<p>(2) Some excellent practical remarks on the wickedness of clipping and
depreciating the currency.</p>

<p>The most interesting but most puzzling sentence in this letter is that
in which he says that 'the ancients wished that the <i>solidus</i> should
consist of 6,000 <i>denarii</i>, in order that the golden coin like a
golden sun might represent the 6,000 years which are the appointed age
of the world.' But how can we reconcile this with any known solidus or
any known denarius? The solidus of Constantine (72 to the lb.) was
worth about twelve shillings. The reduced denarius of Diocletian was
probably worth one penny. At the very lowest (and most improbable)
computation it was worth at least a farthing, and even thus one would
only get 576 to a solidus. The earlier denarius, worth about
eightpence, clearly will not do; and the matter is made more difficult
by the fact that Cassiodorus is talking about the an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>cients (veteres),
whereas the solidus was a comparatively modern coin. It seems that
either Cassiodorus has some entirely wrong information as to the early
currency of Rome, or else that we have not yet got the clue to his
meaning.</p>

the power of testing your merits; for in time of peace the courage

will ye at the same time show that the old valour of your sires yet

command. Bring forth your young men for the discipline of Mars. Let
them see you do deeds which they may love to tell of to their
children. For an art not learned in youth is an art missing in our
riper years. The very hawk, whose food is plunder, thrusts her still
weak and tender young ones out of the nest, that they may not become
accustomed to soft repose. She strikes the lingerers with her wings;
she forces her callow young to fly, that they may prove to be such in

movements of God's great lights; let her nicely adjust the moments of

accurate division of time is unknown. Men are like the beasts, if they

<h3><a name="ii1">1.</a> <span class="smcap">King Theodoric to Anastasius, Most Pious Emperor. a.d.</span> 511.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Consulship of Felix.</div>

<p>'By excellent ordinance of the ancients the year is named from the
Consul. Let the happy year take its title from our new Consul, <i>Felix</i>
[Consul with Secundinus, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 511<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>].</p>

<p>'It is most suitable that Rome should gather back her children to her
bosom, and in her venerable Senate should enrol a son of Gaul.</p>

<p>'Felix showed his excellent disposition first in this, that while
still a young man he hastened to &quot;the native land of all the virtues&quot;
[Rome]. Success followed his choice; we promoted him as he deserved.
While still a young man, deprived of his father's care, he showed the
rare gift of continence; he subdued avarice, the enemy of wisdom; he
despised the blandishments of vice; he trampled under foot the
vanities of pride.</p>

<p>'We have now determined to reward him with the Consulship. Do you who
can with indiscriminate pleasure rejoice in both the blessings of the
Republic [in the Consuls of the East and West] join your favouring
vote. He who is worthy of so high an office as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> the Consulship may
well be chosen by the judgment of both' [Emperor and King].</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the same subject.</div>

<p>An address on his elevation to the Consulship, touching on nearly the
same topics as the <a href="#ii1">preceding</a>.</p>

<p>Theodoric delights in bestowing larger favours on those whom he has
once honoured [a favourite topic with Cassiodorus].</p>

<p>Felix has come back from Gaul to the old fatherland<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>. Thus the
Consulship has returned to a Transalpine family, and green laurels are
seen on a brown stock.</p>

<p>Felix has shown an early maturity of character. He has made a wise use
of his father's wealth. The honour which other men often acquire by
prodigality he has acquired by saving. Cassiodorus evidently has a
little fear that the new Consul may carry his parsimony too far, and
tells him that this office of the Consulship is one in which
liberality, almost extravagance, earns praise<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>; in which it is a
kind of virtue not to love one's own possessions; and in which one
gains in good opinion all that one loses in wealth.</p>

<p>'See the sacred City all white with your <i>vota</i> (?). See yourself
borne upon the shoulders of all, and your name flitting through their
mouths, and manifest yourself such that you may be deemed worthy of
your race, worthy of the City, worthy of our choice, worthy of the
Consular <i>trabea</i>.'</p>

<p>Recommends Felix for the Consulship, going over again the topics
mentioned in the two last letters. It appears that it was the father
of Felix who emerged, after a temporary eclipse of the family
fortunes, and then showed himself 'the Cato of our times, abstaining
from vice himself, and forming the characters of others; imbued also
with all Greek philosophy, he glutted himself with the honey of the
Cecropian doctrine.'</p>

<p>Mention is made of the Consulship of an earlier Felix, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 428, the
happy renown of which still lingered in the memories of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gift obtained from Agapita under undue influence.</div>

<p>[Refers to the same business of Agapita, who seems to have been a
woman of feeble intellect as well as an unfaithful wife.] The petition
of her husband Basilius (vir Spectabilis) sets forth that, influenced
by seducers, and from the levity so natural to woman, she for no good
reason quitted her own home. Her own petition confirms this; and she
states that, while taking refuge within the precincts of the Church,
she by deed of gift bestowed on Provinus the 'Casa Areciretina,' a
most preposterous gift from a poor woman to a rich man; from one whose
reputation was gone to a chaste man; from a half-crazy creature to one
who knew fully what he was about. This gift Agapita [and Basilius] now
seek to annul. Provinus is exhorted at once to throw up a possession
which cannot possibly bring him any credit, and the loss of which has
brought the poor woman to destitution. Alienation of property should
be the act of a person having 'solidum judicium,' which this poor
creature evidently had not, or she would not have left her husband
causelessly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the same subject.</div>

<p>This letter adds a little to the information contained in the
<a href="#ii15">preceding</a> one, as to the career of Liberius, father of Venantius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Praises of Liberius.</div>

<p>Liberius was a faithful servant of Odovacar, who adhered to his master
to the last. 'He awaited incorruptly the Divine judgments, nor did he
allow himself to seek a new King till he had first lost his old one.
On the overthrow of his lord he was bowed by no terror; he bore
unmoved the ruin of his Prince; nor did the revolution, at which even
the proud hearts of the Barbarians trembled<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>, avail to move him
from his calm.</p>

<p>'Prudently did he follow the common fortunes, in order that while
fixedly bearing the Divine judgments he might with the more
approbation find the Divine favour. We approved the faith of the man;
he came over in sadness to our allegiance as one who being overcome
changes his mind, not like one who has contrived [treacherously] that
he should be conquered. We made him Praefectus Praetorio. He
administered the finances admirably. By his economical management we
felt the increased returns, while you knew nothing of added tributes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Apportionment of Tertiae.</div>

<p>'We especially like to remember how in the assignment of the [Gothic]
Thirds (in Tertiarum deputatione) he joined both the possessions and
the hearts of Goths and Romans alike. For whereas men are wont to come
into collision on account of their being neighbours, with these men
the common holding of their farms proved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> practice a reason for
concord. Thus it has happened that while the two nations have been
living in common they have concurred in the same desires. Lo! a new
fact, and one wholly laudable. The friendship of the lords has been
joined with the division of the soil; amity has grown out of the loss
of the Provincials, and by the land a defender has been gained whose
occupation of part guarantees the quiet enjoyment of the whole. One
law includes them: one equal administration rules them: for it is
necessary that sweet affection should grow between those who always
keep the boundaries which have been allotted them.</p>

<p>'All this the Roman Republic owes to Liberius, who to two such
illustrious nations has imparted sentiments of mutual affection. See
to it, Conscript Fathers, that his offspring does not go unrewarded.'</p>

<p>[That is to say, the land given by the Gothic King to Butilian was to
be itself, as a matter of course, free from Tertiae; but, in order
that this might not throw a heavier burden on the other owners in the
district, they were to be allowed to deduct the solidi of that portion
from the gross amount payable by them on behalf of the whole district.
Butilian's own immunity from Tertiae seems to be taken for granted as
a result of the King's gift to him. (See Dahn, 'K&#246;nige der Germanen'

<p>'We always enjoy rewarding public spirit. Decius, Magnificus and
Patrician, has most nobly volunteered to drain the marsh of
Decennonium, where the sea-like swamp, accustomed to impunity through
long licence, rushes in and spoils all the surrounding lands.</p>

<p>'We, in consideration of so great an undertaking, determine to secure
to him the fruits of his labour, and we therefore wish that you,
Conscript Fathers, should appoint a commission of two to visit the
spot and mark out the ground, which is at present wasted by the
inundations, that this land may be secured to Decius as a permanent
possession when he has drained it.'</p>

<p>[The Palus Decennonii is undoubtedly connected with the Decennovial
Canal mentioned by Procopius ('De Bello Gotth.' i. 11), and so called
because it flowed for nineteen miles alongside the Appian Way. In the
Piazza at Terracina there is a very interesting inscription, recording
the fact that Theodoric had ordered that nineteen miles of the Appian
Way should be cleared of the waters which had accumulated round it,
and had committed the work to Caecina Maurus Basilius Decius, 'Vir
Clarissimus et Illustris, Ex-Praefectus Urbi, Ex-Praefectus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> Praetori,

<div class="sidenote">The same subject.</div>

<p>The complement of the foregoing letter, about the drainage of the
marshes of Decennonium, which are hereby granted to him, apparently
'sine fisco,' tax-free.</p>

<p>[But the meaning may be, 'the marshes which you drain <i>sine
fisco</i>'&#8212;without help from the Treasury.]</p>

<p>The chief point of difference between this and the previous letter is
that here Decius is allowed and encouraged to associate partners with
him in the drainage-scheme, whom he is to reward according to their
share of the work. Thus will he be less likely to sink under the
enterprise, and he will also lessen men's envy of his success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hot springs of Aponum.</div>

<p>'The fountain of Aponus&#8212;so called originally in the Greek language as
being the remover of pain<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>&#8212;has many marvellous and beneficial
properties, for the sake of which the buildings round it ought to be
kept in good repair. One may see it welling up from the bowels of the
earth in spherical form, under a canopy of steam. From this parent
spring the waters, glassy-clear and having lost their first
impetuosity, flow by various channels into chambers prepared for them
by nature but made longer by art. In the first, when the boiling
element dashes against the rock, it is hot enough to make a natural
sudatorium; then it cools sufficiently for the tepidarium; and at
last, quite cold, flows out into a fish-pond like that of Nero.
Marvellous provision of Nature, whereby the opposing elements, fire
and water, are joined in harmonious union and made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> soothe the pain
and remove the sickness of man! Yet more wonderful is the moral purity
of this fountain. Should a woman descend into the bath when men are
using it, it suddenly grows hotter, as if with indignation that out of
its abundant supply of waters separate bathing-places should not be
constructed for the two sexes, if they wish to enjoy its bounty<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>.
Moreover, those secret caves, the bowels of the mountains from whence
it springs, have power even to judge contentious business. For if any
sheep-stealer presumes to bring to it the fleece of his prey, however
often he may dip it in the seething wave, he will have to boil it
before he succeeds in cleansing it.</p>

<p>'This fountain then, as we before said, deserves a worthy habitation.
If there be anything to repair in the <i>thermae</i> themselves or in the
passages (cuniculi), let this be done out of the money which we now
send you. Let the thorns and briers which have grown up around it be
rooted up. Let the palace, shaken with extreme old age, be
strengthened by careful restoration. Let the space which intervenes
between the public building and the source of the hot-spring be
cleared of its woodland roughness, and the turf around rejoice in the
green beauty which it derives from the heated waters.'</p>

<p>[The hot-springs of Abano, the ancient Aponum, are situated near the
Euganean Hills, and are about six miles from Padua. The heat of the
water varies from 77&#176; to 185&#176; (Fahr.). The chief chemical ingredients
are, as stated by Cassiodorus, salt and sulphur. Some of the minute
description of Cassiodorus (greatly condensed in the above abstract)
seems to be still applicable; but he does not mention the mud-baths
which now take a prominent place in the cure. On the other hand, the
wonderful moral qualities of the spring are not mentioned by modern
travellers.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

the Phrygian to fierce combat; the Aeolian to tranquillity and
slumber; the Ionian (Jastius), which sharpens the intellect of the
dull and kindles the desire of heavenly things; the Lydian, which
soothes the soul oppressed with too many cares.</p>

philosophers had placed that enjoyment not in sweet sounds but in the
contemplation of the Creator, they would have spoken fitly; for there
is truly joy without end, eternity abiding for ever without weariness,
and the mere contemplation of the Divinity produces such happiness
that nothing can surpass it. This Being furnishes the true
immortality; this heaps delight upon delight; and as outside of Him no

<div class="sidenote">Victories of Clovis over the Alamanni.</div>

<p>Congratulates him on his recent victories over the Alamanni. Refers to
the ties of affinity between them (Theodoric having married the sister
of Clovis). Clovis has stirred up the nation of the Franks, 'prisca
aetate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> residem,' to new and successful encounters. 'It is a memorable
triumph that the impetuous Alaman should be struck with such terror as
even to beg for his life. Let it suffice that that King with all the
pride of his race should have fallen: let it suffice that an
innumerable people should have been doomed either to the sword or to
slavery.'</p>

<p>He recommends (almost orders) Clovis not to touch the panic-stricken
refugees who have fled to the territory of Theodoric. Theodoric
himself has always found that those wars were prosperously waged which
were ended moderately.</p>

<p>Theodoric sends 'illum et illum' as ambassadors, to take certain
verbal counsels from himself, to bring this letter and carry back the
reply, and also to introduce the Citharoedus of whom we heard in the
preceding letter<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>.</p>

<p>[The campaign of Clovis against the Alamanni, referred to in this
letter, is not mentioned by Gregory of Tours. Ennodius, however, in
his Panegyric on Theodoric, and Agathias in his History, make distinct
allusions to this event, and to Theodoric's reception of the
vanquished Alamanni in his own dominions, probably in the valleys of
Raetia.</p>

<p>This letter is very fully discussed by Von Schubert, at pp. 32-43 of
his 'Unterwerfung der Alamannen' (Strassburg, 1884). I may also refer
to 'Italy and her Invaders' iii. 390-91.</p>

<p>[The battle of Vougl&#233; in which Alaric was overthrown by Clovis, was
fought in 507; but the date of this letter is probably 506 (Dahn's
date) rather than 507, as there were no doubt some premonitory
symptoms before the war broke out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>Binding i. 181 (<i>n.</i> 608), and Pallmann ii. 55 <i>n.</i> 1, and 135 <i>n.</i> 2,
incline to a date somewhat earlier even than 506, thinking that there
may have been earlier threatenings of war, which Theodoric succeeded
for the time in averting.</p>

<p>The earlier the date the better will it suit the allusion to Clovis
(and Alaric) as 'Regii <i>Juvenes</i>' in the <a href="#iii2">following letter</a>. Clovis was
born in 466, and was therefore 41 years of age at the battle of
Vougl&#233;.]</p>

<p>Repeats the arguments in <a href="#iii1">iii. 1</a> about the ill effects of war on the
fortunes of all, and says that it is Theodoric's part to moderate the
angry impulses of 'regii juvenes.' It becomes them to reverence

message, hoping that the wisdom of Gundibad may reflect upon what they
say to him [perhaps too delicate a matter to be committed to writing],
and find some way of preserving peace.</p>

<p>[It is remarkable that in this letter Theodoric, who was probably only
52, if the date of it be 506, and who may have been a year or two
younger, speaks of himself along with Gundibad as a <i>senex</i>, and of
Clovis, who could hardly be more than twelve years his junior, as
<i>regius juvenis</i>. Perhaps this is partly due to the fact that
Cassiodorus speaks from his own point of view. To him, now about 26
years of age, Theodoric might seem to be fitly described as 'senex.'</p>

<p>[It is surely possible that this is the dethroned Emperor. The name

was not a very common one in Rome (it must be admitted there is
another Romulus, <a href="#ii14">ii. 14</a>). And is there not something rather peculiar

being questioned.'</p>

<p>[For Liberius, see <a href="#ii16">ii. 16</a>. A man of that eminence, who was employed to
arrange disputes between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> Goths and Romans at the first settlement
of the former in Italy, was the very man to be also employed to
arrange terms with Augustulus. There is some reason to think that the

Bruttii, to confess yourself guilty of the rape of the maiden
Valeriana.</p>

<p>'Overcome, you say, by the severity of your imprisonment and the
tortures inflicted upon you, and longing for death as a release from
agony; being moreover refused the assistance of Advocates, while the
utmost resources of rhetoric were at the disposal of your opponents,
you confessed a crime which you had never committed.</p>

<p>'Such is your statement. The Governor of Bruttii sends his <i>relatio</i>
in opposition, saying that we must not give credence to a petitioner
who is deceitfully seeking to upset a sentence which was given in the
interests of public morality.</p>

<p>'Our decision is that we will by our clemency mitigate the severity of
your punishment. From the date of this decree you shall be banished
for six months; and on your return no note of infamy of any kind shall
be attached to you; since it is competent for the Prince to wipe off
all the blots on a damaged reputation. Anyone who offends against this
decree [by casting your old offence in your teeth] shall be fined &#163;120
(3 lbs. of gold). And all who are accused of the same offence in any
place or time, but who offended through ignorance, are to be freed
from all fear of punishment.'</p>

<p>[A most illogical and unjust conclusion, by which the judgment of
Venantius is in fact neither upheld nor reversed. And what the meaning
of the concluding sentence may be it is impossible to conjecture. See
Dahn, 'K&#246;nige der Germanen' iii. 107, on this absurd decision.</p>

<p>'For it is in the midst of the plains a hill of stone roundly arising,
which with its tall sides, being bare of woods, is all one great

<p>Maffei ('Verona Illustrata,' Book ix. Vol. 2, pp. 391-2 in ed. 1825)
comments on this passage, and argues that <i>Verruca = Dos Trento</i>, a
cliff about a mile from Trient, and this identification seems to have
been accepted, for Ball ('Alpine Guide, Eastern Alps,' p. 404) says:
'In the centre of the valley, close to the city, rises a remarkable
rock known as <i>Dos Trento, and also called La Verruca</i>, formerly
frequented for the sake of the beautiful view which it commands. Since
1857 it has been strongly fortified, and permission to ascend to the
summit is not easily obtained.'</p>

<p>Maffei says that the French bombarded Trient from this rock in 1703.
He speaks of another 'Verruca, or Rocca,' on the other side of
Aquileia, and thinks that the modern word 'rocca' (rock) may perhaps
have been derived herefrom (?).</p>

<p>It is remarkable that there is a place called <i>Verrua</i> near the Po in
Piedmont (about 20 miles east of Turin). 'Situated upon an abrupt and
insulated hill, in a most defensible position, it opposed an obstinate
resistance to the Emperor Frederick II. In more recent times (1704),
the Duc de Vend&#244;me attacked it without success' (Murray's 'Guide to

parties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> charioteers denote the seasons: green for verdant spring,
blue for cloudy winter, red for flaming summer, white for frosty
autumn. Thus, throughout the spectacle we see a determination to
represent the works of Nature. The <i>Biga</i> is made in imitation of the
moon, the <i>Quadriga</i> of the sun. The circus horses (<i>Equi
desultorii</i>), by means of which the servants of the Circus announce
the heats (<i>Missos</i>) that are to be run, imitate the herald-swiftness
of the morning star. Thus it came to pass that while they deemed they
were worshipping the stars, they profaned their religion by parodying
it in their games.</p>

<p>'A white line is drawn not far from the ostia to each <i>Podium</i>
(balcony), that the contest may begin when the quadrigae pass it, lest
they should interrupt the view of the spectators by their attempts to
get each before the other<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>. There are always seven circuits round
the goals (<i>Metae</i>) to one heat, in analogy with the days of the week.
The goals themselves have, like the decani<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> of the Zodiac, each
three pinnacles, round which the swift quadrigae circle like the sun.
The wheels indicate the boundaries of East and West. The channel
(<i>Euripus</i>) which surrounds the Circus presents us with an image of
the glassy sea, whence come the dolphins which swim hither through the
waters<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> (?). The lofty obelisks lift their height towards heaven;
but the upper one is dedicated to the sun, the lower one to the moon:
and upon them the sacred rites of the ancients are indicated with
Chaldee signs for letters<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p><p>'The <i>Spina</i> (central wall, or backbone) represents the lot of the
unhappy captives, inasmuch as the generals of the Romans, marching
over the backs of their enemies, reaped that joy which was the reward
of their labours. The <i>Mappa</i> (napkin), which is still seen to give
the signal at the games, came into fashion on this wise. Once when
Nero was loitering over his dinner, and the populace, as usual, was
impatient for the spectacle to begin, he ordered the napkin which he
had used for wiping his fingers to be thrown out of window, as a
signal that he gave the required permission. Hence it became a custom
that the display of a napkin gave a certain promise of future
<i>circenses</i>.</p>

<p>'The <i>Circus</i> is so called from &quot;circuitus:&quot; <i>circenses</i> is, as it
were, <i>circu-enses</i>, because in the rude ages of antiquity, before an
elaborate building had been prepared for the purpose, the races were
exhibited on the green grass, and the multitude were protected by the
river on one side and the swords (<i>enses</i>) of the soldiers on the
other<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>.</p>

<p>'We observe, too, that the rule of this contest is that it be decided
in twenty-four heats<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>, an equal number to that of the hours of day
and night. Nor let it be accounted meaningless that the number of
circuits round the goals is expressed by the putting up of
<i>eggs</i><a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> since that emblem, pregnant as it is with many
superstitions<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>, indicates that something is about to be born from
thence. And in truth we may well understand that the most fickle and
inconstant characters, well typified by the birds who have laid those
eggs, will spring from attendance on these spectacles<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>. It were
long to describe in detail all the other points of the Roman Circus,
since each appears to arise from some special cause. This only will we
remark upon as pre-eminently strange, that in these beyond all other
spectacles men's minds are hurried into excitement without any regard
to a fitting sobriety of character. The Green charioteer flashes by:
part of the people is in despair. The Blue gets a lead: a larger part
of the City is in misery. They cheer frantically when they have gained
nothing; they are cut to the heart when they have received no loss;
and they plunge with as much eagerness into these empty contests as if
the whole welfare of the imperilled fatherland were at stake.</p>

<p>'No wonder that such a departure from all sensible dispositions should
be attributed to a superstitious origin. We are compelled to support
this institution by the necessity of humouring the majority of the
people, who are passionately fond of it; for it is always the few who
are led by reason, while the many crave excitement and oblivion of
their cares. Therefore, as we too must sometimes share the folly of
our people, we will freely provide for the expenses of the Circus,
however little our judgment approves of this institution.'</p>

<p>[Notwithstanding some absurdities, the above description of the Circus
Maximus (which I have attempted to translate in full) is of great
value, being, after that given by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
chief authority on the subject. The accompanying plan (taken, with
some slight variations, from Smith's 'Dictionary of Antiquities'),
will, I trust, render it intelligible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On Roman land surveying.</div>

<p>'We are sorry to hear that a dispute (which is on the point of being
settled by arms instead of by the law) has arisen between the
Spectabiles Leontius and Paschasius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> as to the boundaries of their
properties<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>. If they are so fierce against one another here in
Italy, where there are mountains and rivers and the &quot;arcaturae&quot;
[square turrets of the land surveyor] to mark the boundaries, what
would they have done in Egypt, where the yearly returning waters of
the Nile wash out all landmarks, and leave a deposit of mud over all?</p>

<p>'Geometry was discovered by the Chaldaeans, who perceived that its
principles lay at the root of Astronomy, Music, Mechanics,
Architecture, Medicine, Logic, and every science which deals with
generals. This science was eagerly welcomed by the Egyptians, who
perceived the advantage it would be to them in recovering the
boundaries of estates obliterated by the wished-for deluge<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> of the
Nile.</p>

<p>'Therefore let your Greatness send an experienced land surveyor
(agrimensor) to settle this dispute by assigning fixed boundaries to
the two estates.</p>

<p>'Augustus made a complete survey of the whole &quot;Orbis Romanus,&quot; in
order that each taxpayer should know exactly his resources and
obligations. The results of this survey were tabulated by the author
Hyrummetricus. The Professors of this Science [of land surveying] are
honoured with a more earnest attention than falls to the lot of any
other philosophers. Arithmetic, Theoretical Geometry, Astronomy, and
Music are discoursed upon to listless audiences, sometimes to empty
benches. But the land surveyor is like a judge; the deserted fields
become his forum, crowded with eager spectators. You would fancy him a
madman when you see him walking along the most devious paths. But in
truth he is seeking for the traces of lost facts in rough woods and
thickets<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> He walks not as other men walk. His path is the book
from which he reads; he <i>shows</i> what he is saying; he proves what he
hath learned; by his steps he divides the rights of hostile claimants;
and like a mighty river he takes away the fields of one side to bestow
them on the other.</p>

<p>'Wherefore, acting on our instructions, choose such a land surveyor,
whose authority may be sufficient to settle this dispute, that the
litigants may henceforth cultivate their lands in peace.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">On Water-finders.</div>

<p>'Your Greatness tells us that a water-finder has come to Rome from
Africa, where, on account of the dryness of the soil, his art is
greatly in request.</p>

<p>'We are glad to hear it. It is a very useful art.</p>

<p>'Signs of the existence of water are the greenness of the grass, the
size of the trees, the nature of the plants, reeds, rushes, brambles,
willows, poplars, &amp;c. Some discover water by putting out dry wool
under a bowl at night. So too, if you see at sunrise a cloud [or
gossamer, 'spissitudinem'] of very small flies. A mist rising like a
column shows water as deep below as the column rises high above.</p>

<p>'The water-finder will also predict the quality of the water, and so
prevent you from wasting labour on a brackish spring. This science was
ably treated of by &#8212;&#8212;<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>, and by Marcellus among the Latins. They
tell us that waters which gush forth towards the east and south are
light and wholesome; that those which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> emerge towards the north and
west are too cold and heavy.</p>

<p>'So then, if the testimonials of the aforesaid water-finder and the
results of his indications shall approve themselves to your wisdom,
you may pay his travelling expenses and relieve his wants: he having
to repay you by his future services. For though Rome itself is so
abundantly supplied with aqueducts, there are many suburban places in
which his help would be very useful. Associate with him also a
mechanician who can sink for and raise the water when he has pointed
it out. Rome ought not to lack anything which is an object of
desire.'</p>

<p>'We gladly acknowledge the price of a favour, in itself beyond price,
which, according to the custom of the nations, we have received from
your ambassadors: namely, a team of horses, silvery in colour, as
wedding-horses should be. Their chests and thighs are suitably adorned
with round surfaces of flesh. Their ribs are expanded to a certain
width. They are short in the belly. Their heads have a certain
resemblance to the stag, the swiftness of which animal they imitate.
These horses are gentle from their extreme plumpness; very swift
notwithstanding their great bulk; pleasant to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> at, still better
to use. For they have gentle paces, not fatiguing their riders by
insane curvetings. To ride them is repose rather than toil; and being
broken-in to a delightful and steady pace, they can keep up their

<p>[A custom had apparently grown up during the lawless years of the
Fifth Century, of litigants helping themselves, during the slow
progress of the suit, to a 'material guarantee' from the fields of
their opponents. This custom, unknown apparently at the time of the
Theodosian Code, was called 'Pignoratio,' and was especially rife in
the Provinces of Campania and Samnium.]</p>

<p>'How does peace differ from the confusion of war, if law-suits are to
be settled by violence? We hear with displeasure from our Provincials
in Campania and Sam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>nium that certain persons there are giving
themselves up to the practice of <i>pignoratio</i>. And so far has this
gone that neighbours club together and transfer their claims to some
one person who &quot;pignorates&quot; for the whole of them, thus in fact
compelling a man to pay a debt to an entire stranger&#8212;a monstrous
perversion of all the rules of law, which separates so delicately
between the rights even of near relations, and will not allow the son
to be sued for the father's debts unless he is the heir, nor the wife
for the husband's unless she has succeeded to the estate. Hitherto our
ignorance has allowed this lawless practice to exist. Now that we know
of it we are determined to suppress it. Therefore, firstly, if any man
lays violent hands on any property to secure an alleged claim, he
shall at once forfeit that claim [and restore the <i>pignus</i>]. Secondly,
where one has &quot;pignorated&quot; for another, he shall be compelled to

him in the hand; and nothing but the fact that Petrus was sheltered by

the opinion that Porticus Curba denotes the Portico of the Secretarium

the Curia immediately adjoined this building, there is practically but

fine of 100 solidi (&#163;60) per horse; not that the injury to the animal
is represented by so high a figure, but in order to punish his
impertinence. Our Sajones, when sent with a commission, are to go
straight to the mark and return, not to make pleasure-tours at the
public expense; and if they disobey this order, they are to pay the
same fine as that just mentioned.</p>

<p>'Moreover, the extra horses (parhippi) are not to be weighted with a

if to mar its otherwise perfect happiness. There is one favourable
feature in the visitation. It does not come wholly unawares. For some
time before, the mountain groans with the strife of Nature going on
inside it, and it seems as if an angry spirit within would terrify all
the neighbourhood by his mighty roar. Then the air is darkened by its
foul exhalations; hot ashes scudding along the sea, a shower of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> drops
of dust upon the land, tell to all Italy, to the transmarine

<p>'Go nearer: you will see as it were rivers of dust flowing, and
glowing streams of barren sand moving over the country. You see and
wonder: the furrows of the fields are suddenly lifted to a level with
the tops of the trees; the country, which but now was dressed in a
robe of gladsome greenness, is laid waste by sudden and mournful heat.
And yet, even those sandy tracts of pumice-stone which the mountain
vomits forth, dry and burnt up as they appear, have their promise of
fertility. There are germs within them which will one day spring to
life, and re-clothe the mountain side which they have wasted.</p>

<p>'How strange that one mountain alone should thus terrify the whole
world! Other mountains may be seen with silently glowing summits; this
alone announces itself to distant lands by darkened skies and changed
air. So it still goes on, shedding its dusty dews over the land; ever
parting with its substance, yet a mountain still undiminished in
height and amplitude. Who that sees those mighty blocks in the plain
would believe that they had boiled over from the depths of that
distant hill, that they had been tossed like straws upon the wind by
the angry spirit of the mountain?</p>

really suffered damage shall be relieved, while no room is left for
fraud.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Haesti, dwellers by the Baltic. Their present of
amber.</div>

<p>[These are the Aestii of Tacitus, dwelling in or on the south border
of the country which is still called Esthonia. Tacitus also mentions
their quest of amber<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>.]</p>

<p>'It is gratifying to us to know that you have heard of our fame, and
have sent ambassadors who have pressed through so many strange nations
to seek our friendship.</p>

<p>'We have received the amber which you have sent us. You say that you
gather this lightest of all substances from the shores of the ocean,
but how it comes thither you know not. But, as an author named
Cornelius [Tacitus] informs us, it is gathered in the innermost
islands of the ocean, being formed originally of the juice of a tree
(whence its name <i>succinum</i><a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>), and gradually hardened by the heat
of the sun.</p>

<p>'Thus it becomes an exuded metal, a transparent softness, sometimes
blushing with the colour of saffron, sometimes glowing with flame-like
clearness<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>. Then, gliding down to the margin of the sea, and
further purified by the rolling of the tides, it is at length
transported to your shores to be cast up upon them. We have thought it
better to point this out to you, lest you should imagine that your
supposed secrets have escaped our knowledge.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p>'We send you some presents by our ambassadors, and shall be glad to
receive further visits from you by the road which you have thus opened
up, and to show you future favours.'</p>

<p>[The collection of amber is also noticed by Pliny ('Nat. Hist.' 37.
2). It is interesting to observe that he there, on the authority of
Pytheas, attributes to the Guttones dwelling on the Baltic shore the
collection of amber, and its sale to the Teutones. These Guttones
were, if we are right in accepting Jordanes' account of the Gothic
migrations, themselves ancestors of the Ostrogoths.]</p>

<p>The past career of the younger brother, Honoratus, who has been
advocate at Spoleto, and has had to contend with the corrupt
tendencies of Provincial judges, full of their little importance, and
removed from the wholesome control which the opinion of the Senate

expressed that, in the words of the Virgilian quotation<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>, this

<div class="sidenote">Duties of the Quaestorship.</div>

<p>The letter to the Senate has an interesting passage on the duties and
responsibilities of the Quaestor.</p>

<p>'It is only men whom we consider to be of the highest learning that we
raise to the dignity of the Quaestorship, such men as are fitted to be
interpreters of the laws and sharers of our counsels. This is an
honour which neither riches nor high birth by itself can procure, only
learning joined with prudence. In granting all other dignities we
confer favours, but from the holder of this we ever receive them. He
is favoured to have a share in our anxieties; he enters in by the
door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> of our thoughts; he is intimately acquainted with the breast in
which the cares of the whole State are weighed. Think what judgment
you ought to form of a man who is partaker of such a confidence. From
him we require skill in the laws; to him flow together all the prayers
of all suitors, and (a thing more precious than any treasure) to him
is committed our own reputation for <i>civilitas</i>. Under a just Quaestor
the mind of an innocent man is at rest: only the wicked become anxious
as to the success of their evil designs; and thus the bad lose their
hope of plunder, while more earnestness is shown in the practice of
virtue. It is his to safeguard the just rights of all men: temperate
in expenditure, lavish in his zeal for justice, incapable of
deception, prompt in succour. He serves that Sovereign mind before
which all bow: through his lips must he speak who has not an equal in
the land.'</p>

<p>Repeats the injunctions given in Letter <a href="#iv47">iv. 47</a> against improper use of
the public post-horses, and overloading of the extra horses. The fines
imposed are the same as in that letter [with the addition of a fine of
two ounces of gold (about &#163;6 10s.) for overloading]; the examples from
Natural History are similar. 'The very bird when weighted with a load
flies slowly. Ships though they cannot feel their toils, yet move
tardily when they are filled with cargo. What can the poor quadruped
do when pressed by too great burden? It succumbs.'</p>

<p>But apparently this rule against overloading is not to apply to
Praepositi (Provincial Governors?), since 'reverenda antiquitas' has

<div class="sidenote">Default in payments to Treasury made by Thomas. His
property assigned to his son-in-law Joannes.</div>

<p>'The <i>Vir Honestus</i>, Thomas, has long been a defaulter (reliquator) in
respect of the Indictions payable for certain farms which he has held
under the King's house in Apulia<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>, and this default has now
reached the sum of 10,000 solidi (&#163;6,000). Repeatedly summoned to pay,
he always procrastinates, and we can get no satisfaction out of him.
The petition of Joannes, who is son-in-law to Thomas, informs us that
he is willing to pay the 10,000 solidi due, if we will make over to
him the said farms, and all the property of his father-in-law. This we
therefore now do, reserving to Thomas the right to pay the debt at any
time before the next Kalends of September, and thus to redeem his
property. Failing such payment, the property is to pass finally into
the hands of Joannes, on his paying the 10,000 solidi to the
Illustrious Count of the Patrimony <b><a href="#err22">[possibly Stabularius]</a></b>.</p>

<p>'It may be some little consolation to Thomas to reflect that after all
it is his son-in-law who enters into possession of his goods.'</p>

<p>[Dahn ('K&#246;nige der Germanen' iii. 277) remarks on this letter: 'But
even the well-meaning Theodoric takes steps in the interests of
substantial justice which from a juristic point of view it would be
hard to justify.... Evidently here the King, in his consideration of
what was practically just, has decided according to caprice, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
according to right; for the Fiscus could strictly only be repaid its
debt out of the property of the defaulter, and hold the Arcarius
(Joannes) responsible for the balance' (for which Dahn thinks he had
already made himself liable). I do not quite agree with this view. It
seems to me that Thomas was hopelessly bankrupt (the debt was 10,000
solidi, not 1,000, as stated by Dahn), and the Fiscus virtually sells
the bankrupt's estate to his son-in-law, for him to make of it what he
can.]</p>

<p>[Does this payment of three solidi mean per head? That would be an
enormously high rate of pay. Sartorius (p. 289) feels the difficulty
so strongly that he suggests that this was the pay given to the whole

this hypothesis<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>. Possibly the high cost of provisions in the

<p>'We send you to redress the long-standing grievances of the
Possessores of the Province of Suavia, to which we have not yet been
able to apply a remedy.</p>

<p>'(1) It appears that some of the chief Possessores are actually making
a profit out of the taxes, imposing heavy burdens on their poorer
neighbours and not honestly accounting for the receipts to us. See
that this is put right, that the land-tax (assis<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> publicus) is
fairly and equitably reimposed according to the ability of each
Possessor, and that those who have been oppressing their neighbours
heal the wounds which they have made.</p>

<p>'(2) See also that a strict account is rendered by all Defensores,
Curiales, and Possessores of any receipts on behalf of the public
Treasury. If a Possessor can show that he paid his tax (tributarius
solidus) for the now expired eighth Indiction (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 514-515), and the
money has not reached our Treasury, find out the defaulter and punish
his crime.</p>

<p>'(3) Similarly with sums disbursed by one of the clerks of our
Treasury<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>, for the relief of the Province, which have not reached
their destination.</p>

<p>'(4) Men who were formerly Barbarians<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>, who have married Roman
wives and acquired property in land, are to be compelled to pay their
Indictions and other taxes to the public Treasury just like any other
Provincials.</p>

<p>'(5) Judges are to visit each town (municipium) once in the year, and
are not entitled to claim from such towns more than three days'
maintenance. Our ancestors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> wished that the circuits of the Judges
should be a benefit, not a burden, to the Provincials.</p>

<p>'(6) It is alleged that some of the servants of the Count of the Goths
and of the Vice-dominus (?) have levied black-mail on some of the
Provincials. Property so taken must be at once restored and the
offenders punished.</p>

<p>'(7) Enter all your proceedings under this commission in official
registers (polyptycha), both for your own protection and for the sake
of future reference, to prevent the recurrence of similar abuses.'</p>

<p>'Then as to the levy of sailors: any fitting man, if a slave, must be
hired of his master, or bought at a reasonable price. If free, he is
to receive 5 solidi (&#163;3) as donative, and will have his rations during
the term of service.</p>

<p>'Even those who were slaves are to be treated in the same way, &quot;since

<p>'Fishermen, however, are not to be enlisted in this force, since we

the stormy wind, and another for him who need only fish close to

<p>'We praise you for your prompt fulfilment of the orders contained in
the previous letter. You have built a fleet almost as quickly as
ordinary men would sail one. The model of the triremes, revealing the

this time a burden rather than an advantage&#8212;enjoyed several special
privileges. We find from the Theodosian Code, Lib. xiv. Tit. 1, that
there were Decuriae of the <i>Librarii</i>, <i>Fiscales</i>, <i>Censuales</i>. The
<i>Decuria Scribarum</i> is perhaps the same as the <i>Decuria Librariorum</i>.
I use the word Guilds, which seems best to describe a body of this
kind; but it will be seen from their names that these Guilds are not
of a commercial character, but are rather concerned with the
administration of justice. Some of them must have discharged the
duties of attorneys, others of Inland Revenue officers, others acted
as clerks to register the proceedings of the Senate, others performed
the mere mechanical work of copying, which is now undertaken by a law

<p>The young Capuanus has distinguished himself as a advocate both before
the Senate and other tribunals. There has been a certain diffidence
and hesitation in his manner, especially when he was dealing with
common subjects; but he always warmed with his peroration, and the
same man who even stammered in discussing some trifling detail became
fluent, nay eloquent, when the graver interests of his client were at
stake. When he saw that the Judge was against him he did not lose
heart, but, by praising his justice and impartiality, gradually coaxed
him into a more favourable mood. On one memorable occasion, when a
certain document was produced which appeared hostile, he boldly
challenged the accuracy of the copy [made probably by one of the
<i>Decuria Librariorum</i>] and insisted on seeing the original. This young
advocate is now appointed <i>Rector Decuriarum</i>, and thus accorded the
privilege of seniority over many men who are much older than himself.
He is exhorted to treat them with all courtesy, to remember the
importance of accuracy and fidelity in the execution of his duties and
those of the <i>Decuriales</i> under him, on whose correct transcription of
documents the property, the liberty, nay even the life of their
fellow-subjects may depend. Especially he is exhorted to remember his
own challenge of the accuracy of a copied document, that he may not
ever find that memorable oration of his brought up against himself.</p>

<p>The Senate is exhorted to give the young official a kindly welcome. It
will now devolve upon him to report with praiseworthy accuracy the
proceedings of that body, the most celebrated in the whole world. He
who has often pleaded before them the cause of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> humble and weak,

chameleon.</div>

<p>'Frontosus, acting worthily of his name [the shameless-browed one],
confessed to having embezzled a large sum of public money, but
promised that, if a sufficient interval were allowed him, he would
repay it. Times without number has this interval expired and been
renewed, and still he does not pay. When he is arrested he trembles
with fear, and will promise anything; as soon as he is liberated he
seems to forget every promise that he has made. He changes his words,
like the chameleon, that little creature which in the shape of a
serpent is distinguished by a gold-coloured head, and has all the rest
of its body of a pale green. This little beast when it meets the gaze
of men, not being gifted with speed of flight, confused with its
excess of timidity, changes its colours in marvellous variety, now
azure, now purple, now green, now dark blue. The chameleon, again, may
be compared to the Pandian gem [sapphire?], which flashes with all
sorts of lights and colours while you hold it still in your hand.</p>

<p>'Such then is the mind of Frontosus. He may be rightly compared to
Proteus, who when he was laid hold of, appeared in every shape but his
own, roared as a lion, hissed as a serpent, or foamed away in watery
waves, all in order to conceal his true shape of man.</p>

<p>'Since this is his character, when you arrest him, first stop his
mouth from promising, for his facile nature is ready with all sorts of
promises which he has no chance of performing. Then ascertain what he
can really pay at once, and keep him bound till he does it. He must

<p>[On Cyprian's appointment to the above office, 524.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Promotion of Cyprian to the Comitiva Sacrarum Largitionum.</div>

<p>The usual pair of letters setting forth the merits of the new
official. The Senate is congratulated on the fact that the King never
presents to a place in that body a mere tyro in official life, but
always himself first tests the servants of the State, and rewards with
a place in the Senate only those who have shown themselves worthy of
it.</p>

<p>Cyprian is the son of a man of merit, Opilio, who in the times of the
State's ill-fortune was chosen to a place in the royal household<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>.
He was not able, owing to the wretchedness of the times, to do much
for his son. The difference between the fortunes of father and son is
the measure of the happy change introduced by the rule of Theodoric.</p>

<p>In some subordinate capacity in the King's final Court of Appeal
(probably as <i>Referendarius</i><a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>) Cyprian has hitherto had the duty
of stating the cases of the hostile litigants. He has shown wonderful
dexterity in suddenly stating the same case from the two oppo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>site
points of view<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>, and this so as to satisfy even the requirements
of the litigants themselves.</p>

<p>Often the King has transacted business in his rides which used of old
to be brought before a formal Consistory. He has mounted his horse,
when weary with the cares of the Republic, to renew his vigour by
exercise and change of scene. In these rides he has been accompanied
by Cyprian, who has in such a lively manner stated the cases which had
come up on appeal, that an otherwise tedious business was turned into
a pleasure. Even when the King was most moved to wrath by what seemed
to him a thoroughly bad cause, he still appreciated the charm of the
Advocate's style in setting it before him. Thus has Cyprian had that
most useful of all trainings, action, not books.</p>

<p>Thus prepared he was sent on an embassy to the East, a commission
which he discharged with conspicuous ability. Versed in three
languages (Greek, Roman, Gothic?), he found that Greece had nothing to
show him that was new; and as for subtlety, he was a match for the
keenest of the Greeks. The Emperor's presence had nothing in it to
make him hesitating or confused. Why should it, since he had seen and
pleaded before Theodoric<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>?</p>

<p>In addition to all these other gifts he possesses <i>faith</i>, that anchor
of the soul amidst the waves of a stormy world.</p>

<p>He is therefore called upon to assume at the third Indiction [524-525]
the office of Count of the Sacred Largesses, and exhorted to bear
himself therein worthily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> of his parentage and his past career, that
the King may afterwards promote him to yet higher honour.</p>

<p>[For further remarks on this letter&#8212;a very important one, as bearing
on the trial of Boethius&#8212;see <a href="#viii16">viii. 16</a>. The third Indiction might mean
either 509-510 or 524-525; but the statement of '<b><a href="#err26">Anomymus</a></b> Valesii,'
that Cyprian was still only Referendarius at the time of his
accusation of Albinus, warrants us in fixing on the later date. This
makes the encomiums conferred in this letter more significant, since
they must have been bestowed <i>after</i> the delation against Albinus and
Boethius. Probably it was during Cyprian's embassy to Constantinople

<div class="sidenote">Rewards to performers in the Amphitheatre.</div>

<p>'If singers and dancers are to be rewarded by the generosity of the
Consul, <i>&#224; fortiori</i> should the <i>Venator</i>, the fighter with wild
beasts in the amphitheatre, be rewarded for <i>his</i> endeavours to please
the people, who after all are secretly hoping to see him killed. And
what a horrible death he dies&#8212;denied even the rites of burial,
disappearing before he has yet become a corpse into the maw of the
hungry animal which he has failed to kill. These spectacles were first
introduced as part of the worship of the Scythian Diana, who was
feigned to gloat on human gore. The ancients called her the triple
deity, Proserpina-Luna-Diana. They were right in one point; the
goddess who invented these games certainly reigned <i>in hell</i>.'</p>

<p>The Colosseum (the Amphitheatre of Titus) is described.</p>

<p>The combats with wild beasts are pourtrayed in a style of pompous
obscurity. We may dimly discern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> the form of the <i>bestiarius</i>, who is
armed with a wooden spear; of another who leaps into the air to escape
the beast's onset; of one who protects himself with a portable wall of
reeds, 'like a sea-urchin;' of others who are fastened to a revolving
wheel, and alternately brought within the range of the animal's claws
and borne aloft beyond his grasp. 'There are as many perilous forms of
encounter as Virgil described varieties of crime and punishment in
Tartarus. Alas for the pitiable error of mankind! If they had any true
intuition of Justice, they would sacrifice as much wealth for the
preservation of human life as they now lavish on its destruction.' ['A
noble regret,' says Gregorovius ('Geschichte der Stadt Rom.' i. 286),
'in which in our own day every well-disposed Minister of a military
state will feel bound to concur with Cassiodorus.']</p>

have kept him there; whereas you have sent him forth furnished with
large supplies of money to disturb the peace of our Gaulish Provinces.
This is not the conduct of a friend, much less of a relative. We are
sure that you cannot have taken counsel in this matter with your wife,

<h3><a name="vi1">1.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Consulship</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Consulship.</div>

<p>'In old days the supreme reward of the Consulship was given to him
who, by his strong right hand, had delivered the Republic. The mantle
embroidered with palms of victory<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>, the privilege of giving his
name to the year and of enfranchising the slave, even power over the
lives of his fellow-citizens, were rightly given to a man to whom the
Republic owed so much. He received the axe&#8212;the power of life and
death&#8212;but bound up in the bundle of rods, in order that the necessary
delay in undoing these might prevent him from striking the irrevocable
stroke without due consideration. Whence also he received the name of
Consul, because it was his duty to <i>consult</i> for the good of his
country. He was bound to spend money freely; and thus he who had shed
the blood of the enemies of Rome made the lives of her children happy
by his generosity.</p>

<p>'But now take this office under happier circumstances, since we have
the labours of the Consul, you the joys of his dignity. Your
palm-embroidered robes therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> are justified by our victories, and
you, in the prosperous hour of peace, confer freedom on the slave,
because we by our wars are giving security to the Romans. Therefore,
for this Indiction, we decorate you with the ensigns of the
Consulship.</p>

<p>'Adorn your broad shoulders<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> with the variegated colours of the

Enter your private dwelling having even your sandals gilded; ascend
the curule chair by the many steps which its dignity requires: that
thus you, a subject and at your ease, may enjoy the dignity which we,
the Ruler, assumed only after mightiest labours. You enjoy the fruit
of victory who are ignorant of war; we, God helping us, will reign; we
will consult for the safety of the State, while your name marks the
year. You overtop Sovereigns in your good fortune, since you wear the
highest honours, and yet have not the annoyances of ruling. Wherefore
pluck up spirit and confidence. It becometh Consuls to be generous. Do
not be anxious about your private fortune, you who have elected to win
the public favour by your gifts. It is for this cause [because the
Consul has to spend lavishly during his year of office] that we make a
difference between your dignity and all others. Other magistrates we
appoint, even though they do not ask for the office. To the Consulship
we promote only those who are candidates for the dignity, those who
know that their fortunes are equal to its demands; otherwise we might
be imposing a burden rather than a favour. Enjoy therefore, in a
becoming manner, the honour which you wished for. This mode of
spending money is a legitimate form of canvassing<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>. Be illustrious

<h3><a name="vi2">2.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Patriciate</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Patriciate.</div>

<p>'In olden times the Patricians were said to derive their origin from
Jupiter, whose priests they were. Mythology apart, they derived their
name from <i>Patres</i>, the dignity of priest having blended itself with
that of Senator.</p>

<p>'The great distinction of the Patriciate is that it is a rank held
<i>for life</i>, like that of the priesthood, from which it sprang. The
Patrician takes precedence of Praefects and all other dignities save
one (the Consulship), and that is one which we ourselves sometimes
assume.</p>

<p>'Ascend then the pinnacle of the Patriciate. You may have yet further
honours to receive from us, if you bear yourself worthily in this
station.'</p>


<h3><a name="vi3">3.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Praetorian Praefecture</span>.</h3>

<p>[On account of the importance of the office a translation of the whole
formula is here attempted, though with some hesitation on account of
its obscure allusions.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Praetorian Praefecture.</div>

<p>'If the origin of any dignity can confer upon it special renown and
promise of future usefulness, the Praetorian Praefecture may claim
this distinction, illustrated as its establishment was by the wisdom
of this world, and also stamped by the Divine approval. For when
Pharaoh, King of Egypt, was oppressed by strange visions of future
famine, there was found a blessed man, even Joseph, able to foretell
the future with truth, and to suggest the wisest precautions for the
people's danger. He first consecrated the insignia of this dignity; he
in majesty entered the official chariot<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>, raised to this height of
honour, in order that his wisdom might confer bless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>ings on the people
which they could not receive from the mere power of the Ruler.</p>

<p>'From that Patriarch is this officer now called <i>Father of the
Empire</i>; his name is even to-day celebrated by the voice of the crier,
who calls upon the Judge to show himself not unworthy of his example.
Rightly was it felt that he to whom such power was committed should
always be thus delicately reminded of his duty.</p>

<p>'For some prerogatives are shared in common between ourselves and the
holder of this dignity. [The next sentence<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> I leave untranslated,
as I am not sure of the meaning. Manso (p. 343) translates it, 'He
forces fugitives from justice, without regard to the lapse of time, to
come before his tribunal.'] He inflicts heavy fines on offenders, he
distributes the public revenue as he thinks fit, he has a like power
in bestowing rights of free conveyance<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>, he appropriates unclaimed
property, he punishes the offences of Provincial Judges, he pronounces
sentence by word of mouth [whereas all other Judges had to read their
decisions from their tablets].</p>

<p>'What is there that he has not entrusted to him whose very speech is
Judgment? He may almost be said to have the power of making laws,
since the reverence due to him enables him to finish law-suits without
appeal.</p>

<p>'On his entrance into the palace he, like ourselves, is adored by the
assembled throng<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>, and an office of such high rank appears to
excuse a practice which in other cases would be considered matter for
accusation<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>.</p>

<p>'In power, no dignity is his equal. He judges everywhere as the
representative of the Sovereign<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> soldier marks out to him the
limits of his jurisdiction, except the official of the Master of the
Soldiery. I suppose that the ancients wished [even the Praefect] to
yield something to those who were to engage in war on behalf of the
Republic.</p>

<p>'He punishes with stripes even the Curials, who are called in the laws
a Lesser Senate.</p>

<p>'In his own official staff (officium) he is invested with peculiar
privileges; since all men can see that he lays his commands on men of
such high quality that not even the Judges of Provinces may presume to
look down upon them. The staff is therefore composed of men of the
highest education, energetic, strong-minded<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>, intent on prompt
obedience to the orders of their head, and not tolerating obstruction
from others. To those who have served their time in his office, he
grants the rank of Tribunes and Notaries, thus making his attendants
equal to those who, mingled with the chiefs of the State, wait upon
our own presence.</p>

<p>'We joyfully accomplish that which he arranges, since our reverence
for his office constrains us to give immediate effect to his decrees.
He deserves this at our hands, since his forethought nourishes the
Palace, procures the daily rations of our servants, provides the
salaries even of the Judges themselves<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>. By his arrangements he
satiates the hungry appetites of the ambassadors of the [barbarous]
nations<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>. And though other dignities have their specially defined
prerogatives, by him everything that comes within the scope of our
wisely-tempered sway is governed.</p>

<p>'Take therefore, from this Indiction, on your shoulders the noble
burden of all these cares. Administer it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> vigour and with utmost
loyalty, that your rule may be prosperous to us and useful to the
Republic. The more various the anxieties, the greater your glory. Let
that glory beam forth, not in our Palace only, but be reflected in far
distant Provinces. Let your prudence be equal to your power; yea, let
the fourfold virtue [of the Platonic philosophy] be seated in your
conscience. Remember that your tribunal is placed so high that, when
seated there, you should think of nothing sordid, nothing mean. Weigh
well what you ought to say, seeing that it is listened to by so many.
Let the public records contain nothing [of your saying] which any need
blush to read. The good governor not only has no part nor lot in
injustice; unless he is ever diligently doing some noble work he
incurs blame even for his inactivity. For if that most holy author
[Moses?] be consulted, it will be seen that it is a kind of priesthood
to fill the office of the Praetorian Praefecture in a becoming
manner.'</p>

<p>'You, to whose care Rome is committed, are exalted by that charge to a
position of the highest dignity. The Senate also is presided over by
you; and the Senators, who wield full power in that assembly, tremble
when they have to plead their own cause at your tribunal. But this is
because they, who are the makers of laws, are subject to the laws; and
so are we too, though not to a Judge.</p>

<p>'Behave in a manner worthy of your high office. Treat the Consulars
with deference. Put away every base thought when you cross the
threshold of every virtue. If you wish to avoid unpopularity, avoid
receiving bribes. It is a grand thing when it can be said that Judges

hundredth milestone.</p>

<p>'You judge, on appeal, causes brought from certain Provinces defined
by law. Your staff is composed of learned men; eloquent they can
hardly help being, since they are always hearing the masters of
eloquence. You ride in your <i>Carpentum</i> through a populace of

of strife. For so great is the power of glorious truth, that even in
the affairs of the stage justice is desired<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>. Take then the robe

applause of the Senate.'</p>


<h3><a name="vi5">5.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Quaestorship</span>.</h3>

<p>[This letter is particularly interesting, from the fact that it
describes Cassiodorus' own office, that which he filled during many
years of the reign of Theodoric, and in virtue of which he wrote the
greater part of his 'Various Letters.']</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quaestorship.</div>

<p>'No Minister has more reason to glory in his office than the Quaestor,
since it brings him into constant and intimate communication with
Ourselves. The Quaestor has to learn our inmost thoughts, that he may
utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> them to our subjects. Whenever we are in doubt as to any matter
we ask our Quaestor, who is the treasure-house of public fame, the
cupboard of laws; who has to be always ready for a sudden call, and
must exercise the wonderful powers which, as Cicero has pointed out,
are inherent in the art of an orator. He should so paint the delights
of virtue and the terrors of vice, that his eloquence should almost
make the sword of the magistrate needless.</p>

<p>'What manner of man ought the Quaestor to be, who reflects the very
image of his Sovereign? If, as is often our custom, we chance to
listen to a suit, what authority must there be in his tongue who has
to speak the King's words in the King's own presence? He must have
knowledge of the law, wariness in speech, firmness of purpose, that
neither gifts nor threats may cause him to swerve from justice. For in
the interests of Equity we suffer even ourselves to be contradicted,
since we too are bound to obey her. Let your learning be such that you
may set forth every subject on which you have to treat, with suitable
embellishments.</p>

<p>'Moved therefore by the fame of your wisdom and eloquence, we bestow
upon you, by God's grace, the dignity of the Quaestorship, which is
the glory of letters, the temple of <i>civilitas</i>, the mother of all the
dignities, the home of continence, the seat of all the virtues.</p>

<p>'To you the Provinces transmit their prayers. From you the Senate
seeks the aid of law. You are expected to suffice for the needs of all
who seek from us the remedies of the law. But when you have done all
this, be not elated with your success, be not gnawed with envy,
rejoice not at the calamities of others; for what is hateful in the
Sovereign cannot be becoming in the Quaestor.</p>

<p>'Exercise the power of the Prince in the condition of a subject; and
may you render a good account to the Judges at the end of your term of
office.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>


<h3><a name="vi6">6.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Magisterial Dignity, and its Excellency (Magister

<p>[The dignity and powers of the Master of the Offices were continually
rising throughout the Fourth and Fifth Centuries at the cost of the
Praetorian Praefect, many of whose functions were transferred to the
Master.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mastership of the Offices.</div>

<p>'The Master's is a name of dignity. To him belongs the discipline of
the Palace; he calms the stormy ranks of the insolent Scholares [the
household troops, 10,000 in number, in the palace of the Eastern
Emperor, according to Lydus (ii. 24)]. He introduces the Senators to
our presence, cheers them when they tremble, calms them when they are
speaking, sometimes inserts a word or two of his own, that all may be
laid in an orderly manner before us. It rests with him to fix a day
for the admission of a suitor to our <i>Aulicum Consistorium</i>, and to
fulfil his promise. The opportune velocity of the post-horses [the
care of the <i>Cursus Publicus</i>] is diligently watched over by him<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>.</p>

<p>'The ambassadors of foreign powers are introduced by him, and their
<i>evectiones</i> [free passes by the postal-service] are received from his
hands<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>.</p>

<p>'To an officer with these great functions Antiquity gave great
prerogatives: that no Provincial Governor should assume office without
his consent, and that appeals should come to him from their decisions.
He has no charge of collecting money, only of spending it. It is his
to appoint <i>peraequatores</i><a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> of provisions in the capital, and a
Judge to attend to this matter. He also superintends the pleasures of
the people, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> bound to keep them from sedition by a generous
exhibition of shows. The members of his staff, when they have served
their full time, are adorned with the title of <i>Princeps</i>, and take
their places at the head of the Praetorian cohorts and those of the
Urban Praefecture [the officials serving in the bureaux of those two
Praefects]&#8212;a mark of favour which almost amounts to injustice, since
he who serves in one office (the Master's) is thereby put at the head
of all those who have been serving in another (the Praefect's)<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>.'</p>

<p>[We learn from Lydus how intense was the jealousy of the grasping and
aspiring <i>Magistriani</i> felt by the Praefect's subordinates; and we may
infer from this passage that Cassiodorus thought that there was some
justification for this feeling.]</p>

<p>'The assistant (Adjutor) of the Magister is also present at our
audiences, a distinguished honour for his chief.</p>

<p>'Take therefore this illustrious office and discharge it worthily,
that, in all which you do, you may show yourself a true Magister. If
<i>you</i> should in anywise go astray (which God forbid), where should
morality be found upon earth?'</p>

<p>'To this your regular office we also add the place of <i>Primicerius</i>

not their offices assured to them till you have confirmed the

and their products, and therefore merchants, are under your sway. The
commerce of salt, that precious mineral, rightly classed with silken
robes and pearls, is placed under your superintendence.</p>

<p>'Take therefore these two dignities, the Comitiva Sacrarum Largitionum

are searched out by you and brought into our Exchequer, since those

reveals the Minister's character in its true light. Avoid loud and
harsh tones in pronouncing your decisions: when we hear you using

bodily qualities show the habit of the mind. We know a proud man by
his swaggering gait, an angry one by his flashing eyes, a crafty one

charms him as if it were a favour.</p>

<p>'Attend also to the provision of suitable delicacies for our royal

inexhaustible supply of provisions brought in by the crowds of our

the difficulty and all the odium of doing it. He has to track out
offenders and hunt them to their very beds, to compel the contumacious
to obey the law, to make the proud learn their equality before it. If
he lingers over the business assigned to him, the plaintiff complains;
if he is energetic, the defendant calls out. The very honesty with
which he addresses himself to the work is sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> to make him enemies,
enemies perhaps among powerful persons, who next year may be his
superiors in office, and thus subjects him to all sorts of accusations
which he may find it very hard to disprove. In short, if we may say it
without offence to the higher dignitaries, it is far easier to
discharge without censure the functions of a Judge than those of the
humble officer who gives effect to his decrees.</p>

<p>'Great is the privilege of being admitted to such close converse with
the King as you will possess, but great also are the responsibilities
and the anxieties of the Referendarius. In the midst of the hubbub of
the Court he has to make out the case of the litigant, and to clothe
it in language suitable for our ears. If he softens it down ever so
little in his repetition of it, the claimant declares that he has been
bribed, that he is hostile to his suit. A man who is pleading his own
cause may soften down a word or two here and there, if he see that the
Court is against him; but the Referendarius dares not alter anything.

adding nothing, omitting nothing. Hard task to speak <i>our</i> words in

<h3>CONTAINING FORTY-SEVEN FORMULAE.</h3>


<h3><a name="vii1">1.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Count of a Province</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Comitiva Provinciae.</div>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Your</span> dignity, unlike that of most civil officers, is guarded by the
sword of war. See however that this terrible weapon is only drawn on
occasions of absolute necessity, and only wielded for the punishment
of evil-doers. Anyone who is determining a case of life and death
should decide slowly, since any other sentence is capable of
correction, but the dead man cannot be recalled to life. Let the
ensigns of your power be terrible to drivers-away of cattle, to
thieves and robbers; but let innocence rejoice when she sees the
tokens of approaching succour. Let no one pervert your will by bribes:
the sword of justice is sheathed when gold is taken. Receive then for
this Indiction the dignity of Count in such and such a Province. So
use your power that you may be able to defend your actions when
reduced to a private station, though indeed, if you serve us well in
this office, we are minded to promote you to yet higher dignities.'</p>


<h3><a name="vii2">2.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of a Praeses</span>.</h3>

<p>[The Praeses had practically the same powers as the Consularis (<a href="#v20">v. 20</a>)
and the Rector (<a href="#v21">v. 21</a>), but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> occupied a less dignified position, being
only a 'Perfectissimus,' not a 'Clarissimus<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>.']</p>

<div class="sidenote">Praesidatus.</div>

<p>'It has been wisely ordered by the Ancients that a Provincial
Governor's term of office should be only annual. Thus men are
prevented from growing arrogant by long tenure of power, and we are
enabled to reward a larger number of aspirants. Get through one year
of office if you can without blame: even that is not an easy matter.
It rests then with us to prolong the term of a deserving ruler<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>,
since we are not keen to remove those whom we feel to be governing
justly. Receive then for this Indiction the Praesidatus of such and
such a Province, and so act that the tiller of the soil (possessor)
may bring us thanks along with his tribute. Follow the good example of
your predecessors: carefully avoid the bad. Remember how full your
Province is of nobles, whose good report you may earn but cannot
compel. You will find it a delightful reward, when you travel through
the neighbouring Provinces, to hear your praises sounded there where
your power extends not. You know our will: it is all contained in the
laws of the State. Govern in accordance with these, and you shall not
go unrewarded.'</p>


<h3><a name="vii3">3.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Count of the Goths in the several Provinces</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Comitiva Gothorum per singulas Provincias.</div>

<p>[Dahn remarks ('K&#246;nige der Germanen' iv. 157): 'We must go thoroughly
into the question of this office. The <i>Comes Gothorum</i> is the most
important, in fact almost the only new dignity in the Gothic State,
and the formula of his installation is the chief proof of the
coexistence of Roman and Gothic law in this kingdom.' I have therefore
translated this formula at full length.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>'As we know that, by God's help, Goths are dwelling intermingled among
you, in order to prevent the trouble (indisciplinatio) which is wont
to arise among partners (consortes) we have thought it right to send
to you as Count, A B, a sublime person, a man already proved to be of
high character, in order that he may terminate (amputare) any contests
arising between two Goths according to our edicts; but that, if any
matter should arise between a Goth and a born Roman, he may, after
associating with himself a Roman jurisconsult<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>, decide the strife
by fair reason<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>. As between two Romans, let the decision rest with
the Roman examiners (cognitores), whom we appoint in the various
Provinces; that thus each may keep his own laws, and with various
Judges one Justice may embrace the whole realm. Thus, sharing one
common peace, may both nations, if God favour us, enjoy the sweets of
tranquillity.</p>

<p>'Know, however, that we view all [our subjects] with one impartial
love; but he may commend himself more abundantly to our favour who
subdues his own will into loving submission to the law<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>. We like
nothing that is disorderly<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>; we detest wicked arrogance and all
who have anything to do with it. Our principles lead us to execrate
violent men<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>. In a dispute let laws decide, not the strong arm.
Why should men seek by choice violent remedies, when they know that
the Courts of Justice are open to them? It is for this cause that we
pay the Judges their salaries, for this that we maintain such large
official staffs with all their privileges, that we may not allow
anything to grow up among you which may tend towards hatred. Since you
see that one lordship (imperium)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> is over you, let there be also one
desire in your hearts, to live in harmony.</p>

<p>'Let both nations hear what we have at heart. You [oh Goths!] have the
Romans as neighbours to your lands: even so let them be joined to you
in affection. You too, oh Romans! ought dearly to love the Goths, who
in peace swell the numbers of your people and in war defend the whole
Republic<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>. It is fitting therefore that you obey the Judge whom we
have appointed for you, that you may by all means accomplish all that
he may ordain for the preservation of the laws; and thus you will be
found to have promoted your own interests while obeying our command.'</p>


<h3><a name="vii4">4.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Duke of Raetia</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Ducatus Raetiarum.</div>

<p>'Although promotion among the <i>Spectabiles</i> goes solely by seniority,
it is impossible to deny that those who are employed in the border
Provinces have a more arduous, and therefore in a sense more
honourable, office than those who command in the peaceful districts of
Italy. The former have to deal with war, the latter only with the
repression of crime. The former hear the trumpet's clang, the latter
the voice of the crier.</p>

<p>'The Provinces of Raetia are the bars and bolts of Italy. Wild and
cruel nations ramp outside of them, and they, like nets, whence their
name<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>, catch the Barbarian in their toils and hold him there till
the hurled arrow can chastise his mad presumption.</p>

<p>'Receive then for this Indiction the <i>Ducatus Raetiarum</i>. Let your
soldiers live on friendly terms with the Provincials, avoiding all
lawless presumption; and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> the same time let them be constantly on
their guard against the Barbarians outside. Even bloodshed is often
prevented by seasonable vigilance.'</p>


<h3><a name="vii5">5.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Palace Architect</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Cura Palatii.</div>

<p>'Much do we delight in seeing the greatness of our Kingdom imaged
forth in the splendour of our palace.</p>

<p>'Thus do the ambassadors of foreign nations admire our power, for at
first sight one naturally believes that as is the house so is the
inhabitant.</p>

<p>'The Cyclopes invented the art of working in metal, which then passed
over from Sicily to Italy.</p>

<p>'Take then for this Indiction the care of our palace, thus receiving
the power of transmitting your fame to a remote posterity which shall
admire your workmanship. See that your new work harmonises well with
the old. Study Euclid&#8212;get his diagrams well into your mind; study
Archimedes and Metrobius.</p>

<p>'When we are thinking of rebuilding a city, or of founding a fort or a
general's quarters, we shall rely upon you to express our thoughts on
paper [in an architect's design]. The builder of walls, the carver of
marbles, the caster of brass, the vaulter of arches<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>, the
plasterer, the worker in mosaic, all come to you for orders, and you
are expected to have a wise answer for each. But, then, if you direct
them rightly, while theirs is the work yours is all the glory.</p>

<p>'Above all things, dispense honestly what we give you for the
workmen's wages; for the labourer who is at ease about his victuals
works all the better.</p>

<p>'As a mark of your high dignity you bear a golden wand, and amidst the
numerous throng of servants walk first before the royal footsteps
[i.e. last in the procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> and immediately before the King], that
even by your nearness to our person it may be seen that you are the
man to whom we have entrusted the care of our palaces.'</p>


<h3><a name="vii6">6.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Count of the Aqueducts</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Comitiva Formarum Urbis.</div>

<p>'Though all the buildings of Rome are wonderful, and one can scarce
for this reason say which are the chief among them, we think a
distinction may be drawn between those which are reared only for the
sake of ornament and those which also serve a useful purpose. Thus,
however often one sees the Forum of Trajan, it always seems a
wonder<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>. To stand on the lofty Capitol is to see all other works
of the human intellect surpassed. And yet neither of these great works
touches human life, nor ministers to health or enjoyment. But in the
Aqueducts of Rome we note both the marvel of their construction and
the rare wholesomeness of their waters. When you look at those rivers,
led as it were over piled up mountains, you would think that their
solid stony beds were natural channels, through so many ages have they
borne the rush of such mighty waters. And yet even mountains are
frequently undermined, and let out the torrents which have excavated
them; while these artificial channels, the work of the ancients, never
perish, if reasonable care be taken of their preservation.</p>

<p>'Let us consider how much that wealth of waters adds to the adornment
of the City of Rome. Where would be the beauty of our <i>Thermae</i>, if
those softest waters were not supplied to them?</p>

<p>'Purest and most delightful of all streams glides along the <i>Aqua
Virgo</i>, so named because no defilement ever stains it. For while all
the others, after heavy rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> show some contaminating mixture of
earth, this alone by its ever pure stream would cheat us into
believing that the sky was always blue above us. Ah! how express these
things in words worthy of them? The <i>Aqua Claudia</i> is led along on the
top of such a lofty pile that, when it reaches Mount Aventine, it
falls from above upon that lofty summit as if it were watering some
lowly valley. It is true that the Egyptian Nile, rising at certain
seasons, brings its flood of waters over the land under a cloudless
sky; but how much fairer a sight is it to see the Roman Claudia
flowing with a never-failing stream over all those thirsty mountain
tops, and bringing purest water through a multitude of pipes to so
many baths and houses. When Nile retreats he leaves mud behind him;
when he comes unexpectedly he brings a deluge. Shall we not then
boldly say that our Aqueducts surpass the famous Nile, which is so
often a terror to the dwellers on his banks either by what he brings
or by what he leaves behind him? It is in no spirit of pride that we
enumerate these particulars, but in order that you may consider how
great diligence should be shown by you to whom such splendid works are
entrusted.</p>

<p>'Wherefore, after careful consideration, we entrust you for this
Indiction with the <i>Comitiva Formarum</i>, that you may zealously strive
to accomplish what the maintenance of such noble structures requires.
Especially as to the hurtful trees which are the ruin of buildings,
[inserting their roots between the stones and] demolishing them with
the destructiveness of a battering-ram: we wish them to be pulled up
by the roots, since it is no use dealing with an evil of this kind
except in its origin. If any part is falling into decay through age,
let it be repaired at once: the first expense is the least. The
strengthening of the Aqueducts will constitute your best claim on our
favour, and will be the surest means of establishing your own
fortune.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> Act with skill and honesty, and let there be no corrupt
practices in reference to the distribution of the water.'</p>


<h3><a name="vii7">7.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Praefect of the Watch of the City of Rome</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Praefectus Vigilum Urbis Romae.</div>

<p>'Your office, exercised as it is in the City itself, and under the
eyes of Patricians and Consuls, is sure to bring you renown if you
discharge its duties with diligence. You have full power to catch
thieves, though the law reserves the right of punishing them for
another official, apparently because it would remember that even these
detestable plunderers are yet Roman citizens. Take then for this
Indiction the <i>Praefectura Vigilum</i>. You will be the safety of
sleepers, the bulwark of houses, the defence of bolts and bars, an
unseen scrutineer, a silent judge, one whose right it is to entrap the
plotters and whose glory to deceive them. Your occupation is a nightly
hunting, most feared when it is not seen. You rob the robbers, and
strive to circumvent the men who make a mock at all other citizens. It
is only by a sort of sleight of hand that you can throw your nets
around robbers; for it is easier to guess the riddles of the Sphinx
than to detect the whereabouts of a flying thief. He looks round him
on all sides, ready to start off at the sound of an advancing
footstep, trembling at the thought of a possible ambush. How can one
catch him who, like the wind, tarries never in one place? Go forth,
then, under the starry skies; watch diligently with all the birds of
night, and as they seek their food in the darkness so do you therein
hunt for fame.</p>

<p>'Let there be no corruption, no deeds of darkness which the day need
blush for. Do this, and you will have our support in upholding the
rightful privileges of yourself and your staff.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>


<h3><a name="vii8">8.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Praefect of the Watch of the City of Ravenna</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Praefectus Vigilum Urbis Ravennatis.</div>

<p>Contains the same topics as the <a href="#vii7">preceding formula</a>, rather less
forcibly urged, and with no special reference to the City of Ravenna.</p>

<p>An exhortation at the end not to be too hasty, nor to shed blood
needlessly, even when dealing with thieves.</p>


<h3><a name="vii9">9.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Count of Portus</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Comitiva Portus Urbis Romae.</div>

<p>'It is a service of pleasure rather than of toil to hold the dignity
of Comes in the harbour of the City of Rome, to look forth upon the
wide sail-traversed main, to see the commerce of all the Provinces
tending towards Rome, and to welcome travellers arriving with the joy
of ended peril. Excellent thought of the men of old to provide two
channels by which strangers might enter the Tiber, and to adorn them
with those two stately cities [Portus and Ostia], which shine like
lights upon the watery way!</p>

<p>'Do you therefore, by your fair administration, make it easy for
strangers to enter. Do not grasp at more than the lawful dues; for the
greedy hand closes a harbour, and extortion is as much dreaded by
mariners as adverse winds. Receive then for this Indiction the
<i>Comitiva Portus</i>; enjoy the pleasures of the office, and lay it down
with increased reputation.'</p>


<h3><a name="vii10">10.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Tribunus Voluptatum</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Tribunus Voluptatum.</div>

<p>[Minister of public amusements, the Roman equivalent to our 'Lord
Chamberlain' in that part of his office which relates to the control
of theatres.]</p>

<p>'Though the wandering life of the stage-player seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> as if it might
run to any excess of licence, Antiquity has wisely provided that even
it should be under some sort of discipline. Thus respectability
governs those who are not respectable, and people who are themselves
ignorant of the path of virtue are nevertheless obliged to live under
some sort of rule. Your place, in fact, is like that of a guardian; as
he looks after the tender years of his ward, so you bridle the
passionate pleasures of your theatrical subjects.</p>

<p>'Therefore, for this Indiction, we appoint you Tribune of [the
people's] Pleasures. See that order is observed at the public
spectacles: they are not really popular without this. Keep your own
high character for purity in dealing with these men and women of
damaged reputation, that men may say, &quot;Even in promoting the pleasures
of the people he showed his virtuous disposition.&quot;</p>

<p>'It is our hope that through this frivolous employment you may pass to
more serious dignities.'</p>


<h3><a name="vii11">11.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula of the Defensor of any City</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Defensor cujuslibet Civitatis.</div>

<p>[Observe that the Defensor has power to fix prices, in addition to his
original function of protecting the commonalty from oppression.]</p>

<p>'The number of his clients makes it necessary for the representative
of a whole city to be especially wary in his conduct.</p>

<p>'At the request of your fellow-citizens we appoint you, for this
Indiction, Defensor of such and such a city. Take care that there be
nothing venal in your conduct. Fix the prices for the citizens
according to the goodness or badness of the seasons, and remember to
pay yourself what you have prescribed to others. A good Defensor
allows his citizens neither to be oppressed by the laws nor harassed
by the dearness of provisions.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Curator Civitatis.</div>

<p>[The Defensor and Curator had evidently almost equivalent powers, but
with some slight difference of dignity. They cannot both have existed
in the same city. It would be interesting to know what decided the
question whether a city should have a Defensor or a Curator.]</p>

<p>This formula differs very little from the <a href="#vii11">preceding</a>, except that the
new officer is told 'wisely to govern the ranks of the Curia.' Stress
is again laid on the regulation of prices: 'Cause moderate prices to
be adhered to by those whom it concerns. Let not merchandise be in the
sole power of the sellers, but let an agreeable equability be observed
in all things. This is the most enriching kind of popularity, which is
derived from maintaining moderation in prices<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>. You shall have the

<div class="sidenote">Comitiva Romana.</div>

<p>'If even bolts and bars cannot secure a house from robbery, much more
do the precious things left in the streets and open spaces of Rome
require protection. I refer to that most abundant population of
statues, to that mighty herd of horses [in stone and metal] which
adorn our City. It is true that if there were any reverence in human
nature, it, and not the watchman, ought to be the sufficient guardian
of the beauty of Rome<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>. But what shall we say of the marbles,
precious both by material and workmanship, which many a hand longs, if
it has opportunity, to pick out of their settings? Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> when entrusted
with such a charge can be negligent? who venal? We entrust to you
therefore for this Indiction the dignity of the Comitiva Romana, with
all its rights and just emoluments. Watch for all such evil-doers as
we have described. Rightly does the public grief<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> punish those who
mar the beauty of the ancients with amputation of limbs, inflicting on
them that which they have made our monuments to suffer. Do you and
your staff and the soldiers at your disposal watch especially by
night; in the day the City guards itself. At night the theft looks
tempting; but the rascal who tries it is easily caught if the guardian
approaches him unperceived. Nor are the statues absolutely dumb; the
ringing sound which they give forth under the blows of the thief seems
to admonish their drowsy guardian. Let us see you then diligent in
this business, that whereas we now bestow upon you a toilsome dignity,
we may hereafter confer an honour without care.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Architectus Publicorum.</div>

<p>'It is desirable that the necessary repairs to this forest of walls
and population of statues which make up Rome should be in the hands of
a learned man who will make the new work harmonise with the old.
Therefore for this Indiction we desire your Greatness to appoint A B
Architect of the City of Rome. Let him read the books of the ancients;
but he will find more in this City than in his books. Statues of men,
showing the muscles swelling with effort, the nerves in tension, the
whole man looking as if he had grown rather than been cast in metal.
Statues of horses, full of fire, with the curved nostril, with rounded
tightly-knit limbs, with ears laid back&#8212;you would think the creature
longed for the race, though you know that the metal moves not. This
art of statuary the Etruscans are said to have practised first in
Italy; posterity has embraced it, and given to the City an artificial
population almost equal to its natural one. The ancients speak of the
wonders of the world [here enumerated and described], but this one of
the City of Rome surpasses them all. It had need to be a learned man
who is charged with the care of upholding all these works; else, in
his despair, he will deem himself the man of stone, and the statues
about him the truly living men.'</p>

men should live without discipline, accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>ing to their own wills. We
therefore appoint you Judge of these two islands. For it is right that
someone should go to the habitations of these men, who are shut out

differences by fair reason.</p>

<p>'Oh ye inhabitants of these islands, ye now know whom our Piety has

<h3><a name="vii17">17.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula concerning the President of the Lime-kilns</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Praepositus Calcis.</div>

<p>'It is a glorious labour to serve the City of Rome. It cannot be
doubted that lime (coctilis calx), which is snow-white and lighter
than sponge, is useful for the mightiest buildings. In proportion as
it is itself disintegrated by the application of fire does it lend
strength to walls; a dissolvable rock, a stony softness, a sandy
pebble, which burns the best when it is most abundantly watered,
without which neither stones are fixed nor the minute particles of
sand hardened.</p>

<p>[The Princeps, as observed on <a href="#Page_96">p. 96</a>, seems to have practically
disappeared from the Officium of the Praefectus Praetorio. Here,
however, we find a Provincial Princeps whose rank and functions are
not a little perplexing. It seems probable that, while still nominally
only the chief of a staff of subordinates, he may, owing to the
character of the superior under whom he served, have practically
assumed more important functions. That superior in this case was a
Comes, whose military character is indicated by the first letter of
this book. The Princeps was therefore virtually the Civil Assessor of
this officer.</p>

<p>The Comes under Theodoric would generally be a Goth; the Princeps must
be a Roman and a Jurisconsult. The business of the former was war and
administration; that of the latter, judgment, though his decisions
were apparently pronounced by the mouth of the Comes, his superior in
rank.]</p>

<h3><a name="vii46">46.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula legitimating Marriage with a First Cousin</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Formula qua consobrina legitima fiat uxor.</div>

<p>'After the laws of the two tables, Moses adds the laws wherein God
forbids marriages between near kindred, to guard against incest and
provide for a wise admixture of divers strains of blood<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>.</p>

<p>'These commands have been extended to remoter degrees of relationship
by the wise men of old, who have however reserved to the Prince the
power of granting dispensations from the rule in the cases (not likely
to be frequent) where first cousins (by the mother's side) seek to
intermarry.</p>

<p>'Acting on this wise principle we permit you to marry C D, if she is
of no nearer kinship to you than first cousin. By God's favour may you
have legitimate heirs from this marriage, which, our consent having
been obtained, is not blameable but praiseworthy.'</p>


<h3><a name="vii47">47.</a> <span class="smcap">Formula addressed to the Praetorian Praefect directing the Sale of
the Property of a Curialis</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Formula ad Praefectum, ut sub decreto Curialis praedia
vendat.</div>

<p>'It is the hard lot of human nature often to be injured by the very
things which were intended as remedies. The prohibition against the
sale of the property of a Curialis was intended for his protection,
and to enable him fearlessly to discharge his share of the public
burdens. In some cases, however, where he has contracted large debts,
this prohibition simply prevents him from saving anything out of the
gulf of indebtedness. You have the power, after making due enquiry
into the circumstances, to authorise the sale of such a property. You
have the power; but as the proceeding is an unusual one, to guard you
against any odium to which it may expose you, we fortify your Eminence
by this our present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> command. Let the Curialis who petitions for this
relief satisfy you as to the cause of his losses, that it may be shown
that they are really the result of circumstances beyond his own
control, not due to his own bad character.</p>

<p>'Wisely has Antiquity laid upon <i>you</i> the responsibility of deciding
cases of this kind, you whose advantage lies in the maintenance of the
Curia. For by whom could its burdens be borne, if the nerves of the
communities should everywhere be seen to be severed<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>?'</p>

<p>'Most earnestly do I seek your friendship, oh most clement of Princes,
who are made even more illustrious by the wide extension of your
favours than by the purple robe and the kingly throne. On this
friendship I have an hereditary claim. My father was adorned by you
with the palm-enwoven robe of the Consul [Eutharic, Consul 519] and
adopted as a son in arms, a name which I, as one of a younger
generation, could more fittingly receive<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>. My grandfather also
received curule honours from you<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> in your city. Love and
friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span> should pass from parents to their offspring, while hatred
should be buried in the tomb; and therefore with confidence, as one
who by reason of my tender years cannot be an object of suspicion to
you, and as one whose ancestors you have already known and cherished,
I claim from you your friendship on the same compacts and conditions
on which your renowned predecessors granted it to my lord and
grandfather of Divine memory<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>. It will be to me something better

commission more fully to your Serenity.'</p>


<h3><a name="viii2">2.</a> <span class="smcap">King Athalaric to the Senate of the City of Rome on his Accession
(a.d.</span> 526).</h3>

<div class="sidenote">To the Senate.</div>

<p>'Great must be the joy of all orders of the State at hearing of the
accession of a new ruler, above all of a peaceful succession, without
war, without sedition, without loss of any kind to the Republic.</p>

<p>'Such has been our succession to our grandfather. On account of the
glory of the Amal race, which yields to none<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>, the hope of our
youth has been preferred to the merits of all others. The chiefs,
glorious in council and in war, have flocked to recognise us as King
so gladly, so unmurmuringly, that it seems like a Divine inspiration,
and the kingdom has been changed as one changes a garment.</p>

<p>'The institution of royalty is consolidated when power thus passes
from one generation to another, and when a good prince lives again,
not in statues of brass but in the lineaments and the character of his
descendants.</p>

<p>'The general consent of Goths and Romans [at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span> Ravenna] has crowned us
King, and they have confirmed their allegiance by an oath. You, though
separated from us by space, are, we know, as near to us in heart as
they; and we call upon you therefore to follow their example. We all
know that the most excellent fathers of the Senate love their King
more fervently than other ranks of the State, in proportion to the
greater benefits which they have received at his hand.</p>

<p>'And since one should never enter your Curia empty-handed, we have
sent our Count, the Illustrious Sigismer, with certain persons to
administer the oath to you. If you have any requests to make to us
which shall be for the common benefit of the Republic, make them
through him, and they are granted beforehand.'</p>


<h3><a name="viii3">3.</a> <span class="smcap">King Athalaric to the Roman People (a.d.</span> 526).</h3>

<div class="sidenote">To the citizens of Rome.</div>

<p>'If a stranger to the royal line were succeeding to the throne, you
might doubt whether the friendship between him and you would endure,
and might look for a reversal of the policy of his predecessors. But
now the person of the King only, not his policy, is changed. We are
determined to follow the revered maxims of our predecessor, and to
load with even more abundant benefits those whom he most kindly
defended.</p>

<p>'Everything was so ordered by our glorious grandfather that on his
death the glad consent of Goths called us to our kingdom; and that no
doubt might remain upon the matter they pledged themselves by an oath
most cordially taken, to accept us as their ruler. We invite you to
follow their example, and like Trajan, we, the Sovereign, in whose
name all oaths are made, will also swear to you. The bearers of this
letter will receive your sworn promise, and will give you ours, &quot;by
the Lord's help to observe justice and fair clemency, the nourisher of
the nations; that Goths and Romans shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span> meet with impartial
treatment at our hands; and that there shall be no other division
between the two nations, except that <i>they</i> undergo the labours of war
for the common benefit, while <i>you</i> are increased in numbers by your
peaceable inhabitancy of the City of Rome<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>.&quot; Raise then your

<p>'He who hears of a change in the ruler is apt to fear that it may be a
change for the worse; and a new King who makes no kind promises at his
accession is supposed to be harbouring designs of severity. We
therefore inform you that we have received the oaths of Goths and

<p>'Gladly would we have announced to you the prolonged life of our lord

from us who loved him, he has substituted us, by Divine command, as
heirs of his kingdom, that through us his successors in blood, he
might make the benefits which he has conferred on you perpetual. And
in truth we hope not only to defend but to increase the blessings
wrought by him. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span> Goths in the Royal City [Ravenna] have taken

order that he might leave his kingdom at peace, and that no revolution
might trouble it after his death.'</p>

<p>'Our grandfather of glorious memory is dead, but we have succeeded
him, and will faithfully repay, both on his account and our own, the
loyalty of our subjects.</p>

<p>'So unanimous was the acclamation of our [Italian] subjects when we
succeeded to the throne, that the thing seemed to be of God rather
than of man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>'We now invite you to follow their example, that the Goths may give
their oath to the Romans, and the Romans may confirm it by a
<i>Sacramentum</i> to the Goths, that they are unanimously devoted to our
King.'</p>

<p>'Thus will your loyalty be made manifest, and concord and justice
flourish among you.'</p>

between Goths and Romans, not merely by both to Athalaric, which we
have not had in the previous letters.]</p>

<h3><a name="viii9">9.</a> <span class="smcap">King Athalaric to Tulum, Patrician</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Praises of Tulum, who is raised to the Patriciate.</div>

<p>'As our grandfather used to refresh his mind and strengthen his
judgment by intercourse with you, so, <i>&#224; fortiori</i>, may we in our
tender years do the same. We therefore make you, by this present
letter, Patrician, that the counsels which you give us may not seem to
proceed from any unknown and obscure source.</p>

<p>'Greece adorned our hero [Tulum] with the chlamys and the painted
silken buskin; and the Eastern peoples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span> yearned to see him, because
for some reason civic virtues are most prized in him who is believed
to be of warlike disposition<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>. Contented with this repayment of
honour he laboured with unwearied devotion for foreign countries (?),
and with his relations (or parents) he deigned to offer his obedience
to the Sovereign, who was begotten of the stock of so many Kings<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>.</p>

<p>[After some very obscure sentences, in which the writer appears to be
celebrating the praises of Theodoric, he turns to Tulum, of whom he
has hitherto spoken in the third person, and addresses him as <i>you</i>.]</p>

<p>'His toil so formed your character that we have the less need to
labour. With you he discussed the sure blessings of peace, the
doubtful gains of war; and&#8212;rare boon from a wise King&#8212;to you, in his
anxiety, he confidently opened all the secrets of his breast. You,
however, responded fully to his trust. You never put him off with
doubtful answers. Ever patient and truthful, you won the entire
confidence of your King, and dared even, hardest of all tasks, to
argue against him for his own good.</p>

<p>'Thus did your noble deeds justify your alliance with the Amal race
[apparently he has received an Amal princess in marriage], and thus
did you become worthy to be joined in common fame with Gensemund, a
man whose praises the whole world should sing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span> a man only made son by
adoption in arms to the King, yet who exhibited such fidelity to the
Amals that he transferred it even to their heirs, although he was
himself sought for to be crowned<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>. Therefore will his fame live
for ever, so long as the Gothic name endures.</p>

<p>'We look for even nobler things from you, because you are allied to us
by race.'</p>

Gensemund seems introduced on purpose to bewilder the reader.]</p>

<p style="text-align: center">[On the elevation of Tulum to the Patriciate.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">The same subject.</div>

<p>'We are conferring new lustre on your body by the promotion of Tulum.
A man sprung from the noblest stock<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> he early undertook the duties
of attendance in the King's bedchamber<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>, a difficult post, where
the knowledge that you share the secret counsels of royalty itself
exposes you to enmity.</p>

<p>'In the dawn of manhood he went forth with our army to the war of
Sirmium [<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 504], showed what one of our young nobles bred in peace
could do in war, triumphed over the Huns<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>, and gave to slaughter
the Bulgarians, terrible to the whole world. Such warriors do even our
nurseries send forth: thus does the prepa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>ration of a courageous heart
supersede the necessity for martial training<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>.</p>

<p>'Returned to the Court he became the most intimate counsellor of the
King, who arranged with him all his plans for campaign, and so
admitted him to his most secret thoughts that Tulum could always
anticipate how Theodoric would act in every fresh conjuncture of
events; and it may be said &quot;by offering him counsel he ruled the
King<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>'He then distinguished himself in the Gaulish campaign [<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 508],
where he was already enrolled among the generals, directing the
campaign by his prudence, and bravely sharing its dangers. In the
fierce fight which was waged at Arles for the possession of the
covered bridge across the Rhone<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>, the bravery of our <i>candidatus</i>
was everywhere conspicuous, and he received many honourable wounds,
those best and most eloquent champions of a soldier's courage.</p>

<p>'But a general ought not to be always fighting. I have pleasure in
relating his next success, which was brilliant yet achieved without
bloodshed. When the Frank and Burgundian again fell out, he was sent
to Gaul [<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 523] to defend our frontier from hostile incursion. He
then obtained for the Roman Republic, without any trouble, a whole
Province while others were fighting. It was a triumph without a
battle, a palm-branch without toil, a victory without slaughter.</p>

<p>'So great were his services in this campaign that Theodoric considered
that he ought to be rewarded by the possession of large lands in the
district which he had added to our dominions.</p>

<p>'A storm overtook him on his return to Italy: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span> remembrance of the
vanished danger of that storm is sweet to us now<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>. In the wide,
foaming sea his ship was swallowed up. He had to save himself by
rowing; the sailors perished; he alone with the dear pledge of his
love [one child?] escaped. Theodoric rushed to the shore, and would
have dashed into the waves to save his friend, but had the delight of
receiving him unharmed, saved manifestly by Divine protection for his
present honours.</p>

<p>'Favour then, Conscript Fathers, the ambition of our <i>candidatus</i>, and
open for the man of our choice the Hall of Liberty<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>. The race of

of Theodoric, that chief of Kings, of glorious memory, I often by my
intercessions obtained for members of your body Consulships,
Patriciates, Praefectures; and now, behold, I am similarly honoured

Patriciate is exalted, since none of my fellow-countrymen will hold

<p style="text-align: center">[Bestowing on him the rank of Comes Domesticorum.]</p>

<p>[I have altered the order of subjects in this letter, to make it
correspond with that of time. There cannot be much doubt that Arator's
<i>pomposa legatio</i> from Dalmatia was his first introduction to the
Court of Theodoric, and preceded his employment as Advocatus.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arator made Count of the Domestics.</div>

<p>'By raising Tulum to the Patriciate we have provided for the military
strength of the State. Now must we see to it that she is equally
adorned by the glory of letters, and for this purpose we raise you,
still in the prime of life, to the rank of <i>Comes Domesticorum</i>. By
your example it was seen that eloquence could be acquired elsewhere
than at Rome, since in your own Province [probably Dalmatia] your
father, who was an extremely learned man, taught you to excel in this
art: a happy lot for you, who obtained from your father's love that
accomplishment which most youths have to acquire with terror from a
master.</p>

<p>'That I may say something here of a very <i>recherch&#233;</i> character<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>, I
may mention that, according to some, letters were first invented by
Mercury, who watched the flight of cranes by the Strymon, and turned
the shapes assumed by their flying squadron into forms expressive of
the various sounds of the human voice.</p>

<p>'You were sent upon a stately embassy<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> by the Provincials of

with a torrent of elo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>quence, you so set forth their needs and the
measures which would be for the advantage of the public, that
Theodoric, a man of cautious temperament, listened to your flow of
words without weariness, and all men desired still to listen, when you
ceased speaking.</p>

<p>'[Since then] you have filled the office of Advocate in our Court. You
might have been a trier of causes (Cognitor): you have preferred to be
a pleader, though to all your advocacy you have brought so fair and
judicial a mind that your eloquence and your zeal for your client have
never exceeded the bounds of truth.'</p>

behalf of justice, while it is the sure mark of a tyrant to refuse to
listen to the voice of the ancient maxims of law. Remember that
celebrated saying of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> Trajan to an orator: &quot;Plead, if I am a good
ruler, for the Republic and me; if I am a bad one, for the Republic
against me<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>.&quot; But remember, that if we are thus severe upon
ourselves we are equally strict with regard to you, and expect you to
follow the example of your noble ancestors, and to abstain from
everything like an infraction of the laws. We confer upon you the

<div class="sidenote">The same subject.</div>

<p>'As a kind of door to our royal favour do we appoint Ambrosius to be
our Quaestor. You know his merits of old: but, to speak only of recent
matters<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>, we may remind you that when your hearts were wrung with

unfortunate for an orator to have eloquence for his only gift, and to
have to obliterate by his oration the unfavourable effect produced on
the multitude by his appearance.</p>

<p>'We consider it not necessary to praise his eloquence. Of course a
Quaestor is eloquent. While some have the government of a Province
committed to them, others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span> the care of the Treasury, he receives the

<p style="text-align: center">[On the election of Pope Felix III, 526.]</p>

<p>[As this letter has an important bearing on the royal rights in
connection with Papal elections, it is translated in full.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Election of Pope Felix III (or IV).</div>

<p>'We profess that we hear with great satisfaction that you have
responded to the judgment of our glorious lord and grandfather in your
election of a Bishop. It was right in sooth to obey the will of a good
Sovereign, who, handling the matter with wise deliberation, although
it had reference to a form of faith alien from his own<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>, thought
fit to select such a Pontiff as could rightfully be displeasing to
none. You may thus recognise that his one chief desire was that
Religion might flourish by good priests being supplied to all the
churches.</p>

<p>'You have received then a man both admirably endowed with Divine grace
and approved by royal scrutiny. Let no one any longer be involved in
the old contention. There is no disgrace in being conquered when the
King's power has helped the winning side. That man makes him [the
successful candidate] his own, who manifests to him pure affection.
For what cause for regret can there be, when you find in this man,
those very qualities which you looked for in the other when you
embraced his party?</p>

<p>'These are family quarrels<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>, a battle without cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span> steel, a
contest without hatred: by shouts, not wounds, a matter like this is
decided.</p>

<p>'For even though the person who is desired be taken from you, yet
naught is lost by the faithful, since the longed-for priesthood is
possessed by them. [They have a Pope, if not just the Pope whom they
wished for.] Wherefore on the return of your Legate, the Illustrious
Publianus, we have thought it right to send to your assembly these
letters of salutation. For we taste one of our highest pleasures when
we exchange words with our nobles; and we doubt not that this is very
sweet to you also, when you reflect that what you did by our
grandsire's order is personally agreeable to ourselves.'</p>

<p>[For remarks on this important letter see Dahn's 'K&#246;nige der Germanen'
iii. 239. He makes it a simple appointment of the Pope by the bare
will of Theodoric, afterwards confirmed by Athalaric. To me it seems
more probable that there had been a contest, threatening the election
of an antipope (as in 498 in the case of Symmachus and Laurentius),
and that the matter had been, as on that occasion, referred to the
arbitration of Theodoric.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opilio appointed Comes Sacrarum Largitionum.</div>

<p>'It is generally necessary to weigh carefully the merits of a new
aspirant to the honours of the Court (aulicas dignitates); but in your
case the merits of your family render this examination needless. Both
your father and brother held the same office<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> which we are now
entrusting to you, and one may say that this dignity has taken up its
abode in your house.</p>

<p>'You learned the duties of a subordinate in the office under your
brother; and often did he, leaning upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span> you as on a staff, take a
little needful repose, knowing that all things would be attended to by
you. The crowds of suppliants who resorted to him with their
grievances, shared the confidence which the people had in you, and saw
that you were already assuming the character of a good judge.</p>

<p>'Most useful also were your services to the throne at the commencement
of the new reign, when men's minds were in trouble as to what should
happen next. You bore the news of our accession to the Ligurians, and
so strengthened them by your wise address that the error into which
they had been betrayed by the sun-setting was turned into joy at the
rising of our empire<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>.'</p>

<p>'We therefore confer upon you the dignity of Count of the Sacred
Largesses from this sixth Indiction (Sept. 1, 527). Enjoy all the
privileges and emoluments which belonged to your predecessors. God
forbid that those whose own actions are right should be shaken by any
machinations of calumny. There was a time when even Judges were
harassed by informers (delatores); but that time is over. Lay aside
then all fear, you who have no errors to reproach yourself with, and
freely enjoy the advantages of your dignity. Imitate your brother:
even though a little way behind him you will still be before most
holders of the office. He was a man of the highest authority and of
proved constancy, and the highest testimony to his merits was afforded
by the fact that even under a successor who was hostile to him the
whole official staff of the palace was loud in his praises<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>.'</p>

<p>[This letter is of great importance, as containing indirectly the
expression of Cassiodorus' opinion on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> trial of Boethius, and the
tendency of that opinion seems to be against him and in favour of his
accusers. Comparing this letter with <a href="#v40">v. 40</a>, addressed to Cyprian,
Cornes Sacrarum Largitionum and <i>son of Opilio</i>, we may with something
like certainty construct this genealogical table:</p>

<p>Now Cyprian, whose ready wit and ingenious eloquence had rendered him
a favourite with Theodoric, is represented to us in the 'Philosophiae
Consolatio' of Boethius (I. iv.) and in the 'Anonymus Valesii' (85) as
the informer by whom Albinus and Boethius were accused of high
treason. Opilio too (no doubt the same as the receiver of this letter)
is described by Boethius (loc. cit.) as a man who on account of his
numberless frauds had been ordered by the King to go into banishment,
had taken refuge at the altar, and had been sternly bidden to leave
Ravenna before a given day, and then had purchased pardon by coming
forward as a <i>delator</i> against Boethius.</p>

<p>Against all this passionate invective it is fair to set this
remarkable letter of Cassiodorus, written it is true in the young
King's name and presenting the Court view of these transactions, but
still written after the death of Theodoric, and perhaps republished by
Cassiodorus in the 'Variarum' after the downfall of the Gothic
Monarchy. In any case the allusions to <i>delatores</i> in this letter,
considering the history of Opilio and his brother, are extraordinary.]</p>


<h3><a name="viii17">17.</a> <span class="smcap">King Athalaric to the Senate of the City of Rome</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The same subject.</div>

<p>This letter, though it does not mention the name of Opilio, is
evidently written on his promotion to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span> office of Comes Sacrarum
Largitionum. It enumerates his good qualities, and declares that it is
marvellous and almost fortunate for Athalaric that so suitable a
candidate should not have been promoted in the reign of his
grandfather. The father of Opilio was a man of noble character and
robust body, who distinguished himself by his abstinence from the
vices of the times and his preference for dignified repose in the
stormy period of Odovacar<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>.</p>

<p>'He was reputed an excellent man in those times, when the Sovereign
was not a man of honour<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>. But why go back to his parentage, when
his brother has set so noble an example. The friendship, the rivalry
in virtue of these two brothers, is worthy of the good old times. Both
are true to their friends; both are devoid of avarice. Both have kept
their loyalty to their King unspotted, and no marvel, since they have
first shown themselves true to their friends and colleagues.</p>

<p>'Distinguished by these virtues, our candidate has been fittingly
allied by marriage with the noble family of Basilius<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>.</p>

<p>'He has managed his private affairs so as to avoid the two extremes of
parsimony and extravagance. He has become popular with the Goths by
his manner of life, and with the Romans by his righteous
judgments<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>; and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span> been over and over again chosen as a referee
(Judex privatus), thus showing the high opinion in which his integrity
is held.</p>

<p>'The Conscript Fathers are exhorted to endorse the favourable judgment
of the King, by welcoming the new Count of Sacred Largesses into their
body.'</p>

<p>[In view of these letters I do not understand what Gibbon means by
saying (cap. xxxix. <i>n.</i> 95), 'The characters of the two delators,
Basilius ('Var.' <a href="#ii10">ii. 10</a>, <a href="#ii11">11</a>;
<a href="#iv22">iv. 22</a>) and Opilio (<a href="#v41">v. 41</a>;
<a href="#viii16">viii. 16</a>), are
illustrated, not much to their honour, in the Epistles of
Cassiodorus.' This is quite true of Basilius, if the person alluded to
in the references given by Gibbon be the same as the informer against
Boethius, of which there may be a doubt; but Opilio is mentioned, as
we see, with the highest honour by Cassiodorus. So, too, is Decoratus,
whom in the same note Gibbon too hastily stigmatises as 'the worthless
colleague of Boethius.']</p>

<div class="sidenote">Promotion of Felix to the Quaestorship.</div>

<p>'It is desirable that those who are appointed as Judges should know

fidelity, your youthful beauty, and your maturity of mind. No client
could ask for more devotion than you showed in his cause; no Judge
found in you anything to blame.</p>

<p>'Receive then now the dignity of Quaestor for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span> sixth Indiction

pleaded.</p>

<p>'You are called Felix; act so as always to merit that name; for it is
absurd to have a name which denotes one thing and to display the
opposite in one's character. We think we have now said enough for a
man of your good conscience. Many admonitions seem to imply a doubt of
the character of him who receives them.' [A maxim often forgotten by
Cassiodorus.]</p>

who can be fitter to take his seat in the Curia than he who has shared

<p>'You know the eloquence of our candidate [Felix], his early triumphs,
his modesty, his fidelity. To leave such a man unpromoted were a
public loss; and he will always love the laws by the practice of which
he has risen to eminence.</p>

<p>'Nor is he the first of his race to earn rhetorical distinction. His
father shone so brilliantly in the Forum of Milan, that he bloomed
forth with undying fruits from the soil of Cicero<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>. He stood

<p>In these two letters the high character and distinguished services of
Cyprian are commemorated. 'Under Theodoric he distinguished himself
both in war and peace. At the time of the war of Sirmium he was
conspicuous both in his resistance to the fiery onslaught of the
Bulgarians and in his active pursuit of them when their ranks were
broken<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>. He then filled, with great credit to himself, the office
of Referendarius<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>. Great was the responsibility of exercising
peaceful as well as warlike offices under such a master as Theodoric.
In fact the training for one was helpful for the other, since it
required a soldier's courage and promptness to be always ready with a
truthful and accurate reply to that keen, firm-minded ruler of
men<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>.</p>

<p>'Thence he was promoted to the dignity of Count of the Sacred

character<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>. He is now growing old in body, but ever young in fame,
and the King heartily wishes him increase of years to enjoy his
renown.</p>

<p>'Rightly, too, is there now conferred upon him the dignity of
<i>Patricius</i>, since he is the father of such noble sons, men whose
childhood was passed in the palace under the very eye of Theodoric
(thus like young eagles already learning to gaze upon the sun), and
who now cultivate the friendship of the Goths, learn from them all
martial exercises, speak their language, and thus give evident tokens
of their future fidelity to the Gothic nation<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>.</p>

<p>'The Senate is therefore exhorted to welcome its thus promoted

<p>[The subject of these letters is indisputably the same Cyprian whom
the 'Anonymus Valesii' speaks of as suborning false witnesses against
Albinus and Boethius, and of whom the latter says ('Phil. Cons.' i.

made on <a href="#viii16">Letters 16</a> and <a href="#viii17">17</a>; and remember that this letter was composed
three years after the death of Boethius, when Theodoric also was dead,
and his daughter was only too willing to retrace his steps, in all
that concerned the severities of the latter years of his reign. For

to meet the desires of the petitioners, we by the authority of this
letter decree in regular course<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>:</p>

<p>'That if anyone shall think he has a good cause for going to law with
a person belonging to the Roman clergy, he shall first present himself
for hearing at the judgment-seat of the most blessed Pope, in order
that the latter may either decide between the two in his own holy
manner, or may delegate the cause to a Jurisconsult to be ended by
him. And if, perchance, which it is impiety to believe, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
reasonable desire of the petitioner shall have been evaded, then may
he come to the secular courts with his grievance, when he can prove
that his petitions have been spurned by the Bishop of the aforesaid
See<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>.</p>

<p>'Should any litigant be so dishonest and so irreverent, both towards
the Holy See and our authority, as to disregard this order [and
proceed first in our tribunals against one of the Roman clergy], he
shall forfeit 10 lbs. of gold [&#163;400], to be exacted by the officers of
the Count of Sacred Largesses and distributed by the Pope to the poor;
and he shall lose his suit in addition, notwithstanding any decree
which he may have gained in the secular court.</p>

<p>'Meanwhile do you, whom our judgments thus venerate, live according to
the ordinances of the Church. It is a great wickedness in you to admit
such crimes as do not become the conversation even of secular men.
Your profession is the heavenly life. Do not condescend to the
grovelling wishes and vulgar errors of ordinary mortals. Let the men
of this world be coerced by human laws; do you obey the precepts of
righteousness.'</p>

<p>[See Dahn, 'K&#246;nige der Germanen' iii. 191-2, Sartorius 145, and
Bauer's 'History of the Popes' ii. 323-4, for remarks on this
important <i>privilegium</i>.</p>

<p>It is clear that it relates to civil, not criminal procedure, and that
it does leave a right of final appeal from the Papal Courts to the
dissatisfied secular litigant. At the same time, that such an appeal
would be prosecuted with immense difficulty is clear even from the
words of the decree. The appellant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span> will have to satisfy the King's
Judges of a thing which it is almost impiety to believe, that the
occupant of the Roman See has spurned his petitions.]</p>


<h3><a name="viii25">25.</a> <span class="smcap">King Athalaric to Joannes, Vir Spectabilis, Referendarius</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Confirmation of Tulum's gift of property in the
Lucullanum.</div>

<p>'It is a very fitting thing to confirm the generosity of others
towards persons who might well have received gifts from oneself. We
therefore declare that in your case the gift is another's but the will
to give is our own, and the King has only been anticipated by the
rapid bounty of the subject<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>.</p>

<p>'Everyone knows that our grandfather wished to give you the house of
Agnellus in the Castrum Lucullanum, but could not do so having already
given it to the Patrician Tulum<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>. Tulum, however, with his usual
generosity, seconding the wishes of his master, formally conveyed the
property to you; and that conveyance we now confirm, guaranteeing the
quiet possession of it to you and your heirs for all time to come. If
any doubt exist as to your title, by any mischance, or by reason of
any enquiry, such doubt is exploded by the authority of this letter of
ours<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>.</p>

<p>'And should any envious person, in contempt of our royal will, dare to
raise any question in this matter hereafter, either on behalf of the
Fiscus or of any private individual, we declare that he shall pay to
you, or to the person to whom you may have assigned the said house,
100 lbs. of gold (&#163;4,000) by way of penalty.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>[Why should there be the necessity of this royal confirmation of a
transaction between two private individuals, Tulum and Joannes, and
this tremendous penalty on all future impugners of it?</p>

<p>Evidently because the property had been impressed with the character
of State domain, and it was doubtful how far Tulum's alienation of it
might stand good against the claims of future Sovereigns.</p>

<p>This becomes quite clear when we reflect what is the property to which
this letter refers. It is either the whole or a part of the
Lucullanum, to which the deposed Emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was
banished in 476. On his death, as we may conjecture, this property,
one of the most delightful places of residence in Italy, has been
given by Theodoric to Tulum, perhaps just after he had distinguished
himself in the Gaulish campaign of 508. For some reason or other,
Tulum has alienated it (ostensibly, given it) to the Reporter Joannes,
no doubt a Roman, who is apparently nervous lest his title to it
should hereafter be impugned on the ground that the palace of the last
Roman Emperor was national property. Hence this letter. There is some
difficulty and variation between the MSS. in the words describing the
property: 'Saepe dicta domus paternae recordationis Agnelli, in
Lucullano castro posita.' For <i>paternae</i>, Migne's editor reads
<i>patriciae</i>. The forthcoming critical edition of the 'Variae' will
show whether there is any support in the MSS. for a conjecture which I
cannot help entertaining that <i>Agnelli</i> is an error for <i>Augustuli</i>.]</p>

You are so far moulded by the character of our grandfather that you

conciliated for us, by our obeying the principles of justice. If
anyone is in need of anything, let him seek to obtain it from the
generosity of his Sovereign rather than by the strength of his own
right hand, since it is for your advantage that the Romans be at
peace, who, in filling our Treasury, at the same time multiply your
donatives.'</p>

<p>[This letter is evidently addressed to Goths, and Quidila the <i>Prior</i>,
who is set over them, is also a Goth. We can only conjecture what the
office of Prior was: probably to some extent it involved civil as well
as military authority. The conjecture of Dahn ('K&#246;nige der Germanen'
iv. 173) that it corresponds to the Gothic <i>Hundafath</i> (Centenarius),
seems to me extremely probable. The title of the letter is curious. It
is addressed 'Universis Reatinis et Nursinis.' Are we then to suppose
that strong military colonies of Goths had been settled in these
places, the Roman inhabitants having been extruded? The fact that St.
Benedict was born in Nursia, some fifty-seven years before the writing
of this letter, gives an additional interest to this question.]</p>

<p>'Through love of your city our grandfather, with royal generosity,
constructed an aqueduct of the ancient type<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> for you. But it is of

order. Therefore let your Sublimity set the citizens of Parma

who was unfit for human society by forbidding all men to give him
water. Therefore you ought all heartily to combine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span> for this most
useful work, since the man who is not touched by the comeliness of his
city has not yet the mind of a citizen.'</p>


<h3><a name="viii31">31.</a> <span class="smcap">King Athalaric to Severus, Vir Spectabilis</span>.</h3>

<p>[Is Severus <i>Vicarius Urbis</i>? His title Spectabilis seems to require
some such rank as this, otherwise he seems more like a <i>Corrector</i>
(Clarissimus) <i>Bruttiorum et Lucaniae</i>. Perhaps already the strict
gradation established by Diocletian and Constantine was somewhat
broken down, and governors received higher titles than strictly
belonged to them.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissuasions from a country life, and praises of
Cassiodorus' native land of Bruttii.</div>

<p>'Since you, when on the staff of the Praefect, have learned the
principles of statesmanship, we are sure that you will agree with us
that cities are the chief ornament of human society. Let the wild
beasts live in fields and woods: men ought to draw together into
cities. Even among birds we see that those of gentle disposition&#8212;like
thrushes, storks, and doves&#8212;love to flock together, while the greedy
hawk, intent on its bloody pastime, seeks solitude.</p>

<p>'Now we say that the man who shuns human society becomes at once an
object of suspicion. Let therefore the Possessores and Curiales of
Bruttii return to their cities. The Coloni may cultivate the
soil&#8212;that is what their name denotes<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>; but the men whom we
decorate with civic honours ought to live in cities.</p>

<p>'In truth it is a lovely land. Ceres and Pallas have crowned it with
their respective gifts (corn and oil); the plains are green with
pastures, the slopes are purple with vineyards. Above all is it rich
in its vast herds of horses<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>, and no wonder, since the dense shade
of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span> forests protects them from the bites of flies, and provides
them with ever verdant pasture even in the height of summer. Cool
waters flow from its lofty heights; fair harbours on both its shores
woo the commerce of the world.</p>

<p>'There the countryman enjoys the good food of the citizen, the poor
man the abundance of the wealthy<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>. If such then be the charms even
of the country in your Province, why should you shirk living in its
cities<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>?</p>

<p>'Why should so many men refined by literature skulk in obscurity? The
boy goes to a good school, becomes imbued with the love of letters,
and then, when he is come to man's estate and should be seeking the
Forum in order to display his talents, he suddenly changes into a
boor, unlearns all that he has learned, and in his love for the fields
forgets what is due to a reasonable love for himself. And yet even
birds love human fellowship, and the nightingale boldly rears her
brood close to the haunts of men.</p>

<p>'Let the cities then return to their old splendour; let none prefer
the charms of the country to the walls reared by the men of old. Why
should not everyone be attracted by the concourse of noble persons, by
the pleasures of converse with his equals? To stroll through the
Forum, to look in at some skilful craftsman at his work, to push one's
own cause through the law courts, then between whiles to play with the
counters of Palamedes (draughts), to go to the baths with one's
acquaintances, to indulge in the friendly emulation of the
banquet&#8212;these are the proper employments of a Roman noble; yet not
one of them is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span> tasted by the man who chooses to live always in the
country with his farm-servants<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>.</p>

<p>'We order therefore that all Possessores and Curiales shall, according
to their relative means, find bail and give bonds, promising that they
will for the larger part of the year reside in some city, such as they
may choose<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>. And thus, while not wholly debarred from the
pleasures of the country, they will furnish to the cities their proper
adornment of citizens.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fountain of Arethusa.</div>

<p>'Nimfadius (Vir Sublimis) was journeying to the King's Comitatus on
some affair of his own, when, wearied with his journey, he lay down to
rest, and let his beasts of burden graze round the fountain of
Arethusa.</p>

<p>'This fountain, situated in the territory of Squillace<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>, at the
foot of the hills and above the sand of the sea, makes a green and
pleasant place all round it, fringed with rustling reeds as with a
crown. It has certain marvellous properties: for let a man go to it in
silence and he sees it calmly flowing, more like a pond than a
fountain. But let him cough or speak with a loud voice, and it becomes
violently agitated, heaving to and fro like a pot boiling. Strange
power this of a fountain to answer a man. I have read that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
fountains can change the colours of the animals that drink at them;
that others can turn wood dropped into them to stone. The human reason
is altogether unable to understand such things as these.</p>

<p>'But let us return to the complaint of our suppliant. Nimfadius
asserts that, while he was resting, the country people artfully drove
off his beasts of burden.</p>

<p>'This kind of crime brings our times into disgrace, and turns the
charm of that quiet resting-place into disgust. Diligently enquire
into it, for the credit of our Comitatus is involved in our subjects
being able to journey to it in safety. At first, no doubt, the
offenders will lie close, and seem as silent as the unmoved Arethusa.
But begin your investigations, and they will soon break forth, like
that fountain, with angry exclamations, in the midst of which you will
discover the truth. Punish the offenders severely; for we should
regret that owing to the excesses of robbers that wonderful and
joy-bringing fountain should be deserted.'</p>

<p>'We hear that the rustics are indulging in disorderly practices, and
robbing the market-people who come from all quarters to the chief fair
of Lucania on the day of St. Cyprian. This must by all means be
suppressed, and your Respectability should quietly collect a
sufficient number of the owners and tenants of the adjoining
farms<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> to overpower these freebooters and bring them to justice.
Any rustic or other person found guilty of disturbing the fair should
be at once punished with the stick<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>, and then exhibited with some

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p><p>'This fair, which according to the old superstition was named
Leucothea [after the nymph], from the extreme purity of the fountain
at which it is held, is the greatest fair in all the surrounding
country. Everything that industrious Campania, or opulent Bruttii, or
cattle-breeding Calabria<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>, or strong Apulia produces, is there to
be found exposed for sale, on such reasonable terms that no buyer goes
away dissatisfied. It is a charming sight to see the broad plains
filled with suddenly-reared houses formed of leafy branches
intertwined: all the beauty of the most leisurely-built city, and yet
not a wall to be seen. There stand ready boys and girls, with the
attractions which belong to their respective sexes and ages, whom not
captivity but freedom sets a price upon. These are with good reason
sold by their parents, since they themselves gain by their very
servitude. For one cannot doubt that they are benefited even as slaves
[or servants?], by being transferred from the toil of the fields to
the service of cities<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>.</p>

<p>'What can I say of the bright and many-coloured garments? what of the
sleek and well-fed cattle offered at such a price as to tempt any
purchaser?</p>

<p>'The place itself is situated in a wide and pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span> plain, a suburb
of the ancient city of Cosilinum, and has received the name of

<p>'And this is in truth a marvellous fountain, full and fresh, and of
such transparent clearness that when you look through it you think you
are looking through air alone. Choice fishes swim about in the pool,
perfectly tame, because if anyone presumes to capture them he soon
feels the Divine vengeance. On the morning which precedes the holy
night [of St. Cyprian], as soon as the Priest begins to utter the
baptismal prayer, the water begins to rise above its accustomed
height. Generally it covers but five steps of the well, but the brute
element, as if preparing itself for miracles, begins to swell, and at
last covers two steps more, never reached at any other time of the
year. Truly a stupendous miracle, that streams of water should thus
stand still or increase at the sound of the human voice, as if the
fountain itself desired to listen to the sermon.</p>

<p>'Thus hath Lucania a river Jordan of her own. Wherefore, both for
religion's sake and for the profit of the people, it behoves that good
order should be kept among the frequenters of the fair, since in the
judgment of all, that man must be deemed a villain who would sully the
joys of such happy days.'</p>

injustice! What an insupportable evil! that he who ought to have
benefited the Republic by his services, should often lose both fortune
and liberty.</p>

<p>'Wherefore by this edict we decree that if any Curialis suffer
oppression, if anyone, without the express warrant of ourselves or the
high officers of State whose business it is, inflict upon a Curialis
any injury or loss of property, he shall pay a fine of 10 lbs. of gold
(&#163;400), to go to the benefit of the person thus oppressed; or, if his
property be insufficient to pay this fine, he shall be beaten with
clubs. The Curialis must then give additional diligence to the
discharge of his public duties, since his debt to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span> State is, as it
were, increased by the protection which we are thus affording him. As
for the farms of Curiales, in connection with which the greatest
frauds are practised on poor men, let no one seek to obtain them by an
unlawful purchase; for a contract cannot be called a contract when it
is in violation of the law<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>. The Judges must help the Curiales
against the molestations of Sajones and other officials. It is a
grievous offence, when the very person to whom is entrusted the duty
of defending the weak, himself turns oppressor.</p>

<p>'Raise your heads in hope, oh ye oppressed ones! lift up your hearts,
ye who are weighed down with a load of evils! To each citizen his own
city is his Republic. Administer justice in your cities in conformity
with the general will. Let your various ranks live on a footing of
justice. Do not oppress the weak, lest you in your turn be deservedly
oppressed by the strong. This is the penalty of wrong-doing, that each
one suffers in his own person what he has wantonly inflicted on
another.</p>

<p>'Live then in justice and moderation. Follow the example of the
cranes, who change the order of their flight, making foremost
hindmost, and hindmost foremost, without difficulty, each willingly
obeying its fellow&#8212;a commonwealth of birds.</p>

<p>'You have, according to the laws, power over your citizens. Not in
vain has Antiquity conceded to you the title of Curia: not vainly did
it call you the Lesser Senate, the nerves and vital organs of the
State<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>. What is not contained of honour and power in that title!

<p>'Gold, as well as many other fair fruits of Nature which gold can buy,
is said to be produced by our generous Italy. Theodorus, who is an
expert in such matters, asserts that gold will be found on the farm
Rusticiana in Bruttii<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>. Let your Greatness therefore send a
<i>Cartarius</i> to commence mining operations on that spot. The work of a
miner resembles that of a mole. He burrows underground, far from the
light of day. Sometimes the sides of his passages fall in and his way
is closed up behind him; but if he emerge safely with his treasure,
how happy is he! Then the gold-miner proceeds to immerse his ore in
water, that the heavy metal may be separated from the lighter earth;
then to submit it to a fervent heat, that it may thence derive its
beautiful colour<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>.</p>

<p>'Let then the land of Bruttii pay her tribute in gold, the most
desired of all treasure. To seek gold by war is wicked, by voyages
dangerous, by swindling shameful; but to seek it from Nature in its
own home is righteous. No one is hurt by this honest gain. Griffins
are said to dig for gold and to delight in the contemplation of this
metal; but no one blames them, because their proceedings are not
dictated by criminal covetousness. For it is not the act itself, but
the motive for the act, that gives it its moral quality.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

captivity in which the other Senators were kept at Ravenna by Witigis,

<p>'Lately we announced to you our accession: now we wish to confer upon
you a benefit in the matter of taxes. For we look on that only as our
revenue which the cultivator pays cheerfully. Our grandfather,
considering the great increase in wealth and population which his long

the taxes to be paid by the Province of Sicily<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>. He was quite

hereby remit to you all the augmentum which was assessed upon you at
the fourth Indiction. And not only so, but all that you have already
paid under this head for the fifth Indiction (526-7) we direct the
tax-collectors to carry to your credit on account<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>.</p>

<p>'Besides this, if anyone have to complain of oppression on the part of
the Governors of the Province, let him seek at once a remedy from our

slowness of the Governors to obey their letters of recall, feeling
sure that they were lingering in the Provinces neither for his good
nor yours.</p>

<p>'Your Greatness informs us of cases that have come to your knowledge,
in which the Guards (Domestici) attending the Counts who are appointed
[to the government of various Provinces] have oppressed the
Provincials by their exactions. As we believe that there is some
excuse for this in the smallness of their <i>emolumenta</i>, which at
present consist of only 200 solidi (&#163;120) and ten rations (Annonae),
we direct that you henceforth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span> pay them, as from the fifth Indiction
(Sept. 526), 50 solidi (&#163;30) annually, in addition to the above,
charging this further payment to our account. By taking away
Necessity, the mother of crimes, we hope that the practice of sinning
will also be removed. If, after this, anyone is found oppressing the
Provincials, let him lose his <i>emolumenta</i> altogether. Our gifts
ennoble the receiver, and are given in order to take away from him any
pretext for begging from others.'</p>

<p>[The Domestici were a very select corps of Life-guardsmen; probably
only a very small number of them would accompany a Provincial Governor
to his charge. This may explain what seems an extraordinarily high
rate of pay. Perhaps it is the Comes himself, not his Domestici, who
is to receive the emolumenta here specified; but, if so, the letter is
very obscurely expressed.]</p>

<p>'We hear great complaints of you from the Sicilians; but, as they are

give you the following warning:</p>

<p>'(1) You are said to have extorted large sums from them on pretence of
rebuilding the walls, which you have not done. Either repay them the

<p>'(2) You are said to be claiming for the Exchequer (under the name of

the case of strangers dying without heirs, natural or testamentary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>'(3) You are said to be oppressing the suitors in the Courts with
grievous charges<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>, so that you make litigation utterly ruinous to
those who undertake it.</p>

<p>'We order therefore that when <i>our</i><a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> decrees are being enforced
against a beaten litigant, the gratuity claimed by the officer shall
be the same which our glorious grandfather declared to be

gratuities ought not to be excessive<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>.</p>

interfere<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>&#8212;then your officer must receive half the gratuity

improper that the man who only performs <i>your</i> orders should receive
as much as is paid out of reverence for <i>our</i> command. Anyone
infringing this constitution is to restore fourfold.</p>

<p>'(4) The edicts of our glorious grandfather, and all the precepts
which he made for the government of Sicily, are to be so obediently

our commands<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>.</p>

<p>'(5) It is said that you cite causes between two Romans, even against
their will, before your tribunal. If you are conscious that this has
been done by you, do not so presume in future, lest while seeking the
office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span> Judge, for which you are incompetent, you wake up to find
yourself a culprit. You, of all men, ought to be mindful of the
Edictum, since you insist on its being followed by others. If not, if
this rule is not observed by you, your whole power of decreeing shall
be taken from you. Let the administration of the laws be preserved
intact to the <i>Judices Ordinarii</i>. Let the litigants throng, as they
ought to do, to the Courts of their <i>Cognitores</i>. Do not be gnawed by
envy of their pomp. The true praise of the Goths is
<i>law-abidingness</i><a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>. The more seldom the litigant is seen in your
presence the greater is your renown. Do you defend the State with your
arms; let the Romans plead before their own law courts in peace.</p>

<p>'(6) You are also accused of insisting on buying the cargoes of
vessels that come to the port at your own price [and selling again at
a higher]&#8212;a practice the very suspicion of which is injurious to an
official, even if it cannot be proved against him in fact<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>.
Wherefore, if you wish to avoid the rumour of this deed, let the

your conscience<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>. Prices ought to be fixed by the common
deliberation [of buyer and seller]; since no one likes a commercial
transaction which is forced upon the unwilling.</p>

<p>'Wherefore we have thought it proper to warn your Sublimity by these
presents, since we do not like those whom we love to be guilty of
excess, nor to hear evil reports of those who are charged with
reforming the morals of others.'</p>

<p>[This is an important letter, especially when taken in connection with
the words of Totila (Procopius, 'De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span> Bello Gotthico' iii. 16), as to
the exceptional indulgence with which the Gothic Kings had treated
Sicily, 'leaving, at the request of the inhabitants, very few soldiers
in the island, that there might be no distaste to their freedom or to
their general prosperity.'</p>

<p>Gildias is evidently a Goth, and though a <i>Vir Spectabilis</i> and
holding a Roman office&#8212;the Comitiva Syracusanae Civitatis&#8212;still it
is essentially a military office, and he has no business to divert
causes from the Judices Ordinarii to his tribunal, though probably a
Roman Comes might often do this without serious blame. But by his
doing so, the general principle, that in purely Roman causes a Goth is
not to interfere, seems to be infringed, and therefore he receives
this sharp reprimand to prevent his doing it again.]</p>

petition that lately, when a President was sought for the Papal chair,
so much were the usual largesses to the poor augmented by the promises
which had been extorted from the candidate, that, shameful to say,
even the sacred vessels were exposed to sale in order to provide the
necessary money<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>.</p>

<p>'Therefore let your Holiness know that by this present decree, which
relates also to all the Patriarchs and Metropolitan Churches [the five
Metropolitan Churches in Rome, and such Sees as Milan, Aquileia,
Ravenna], we confirm the wise law passed by the Senate in the time of
the most holy Pope Boniface [predecessor of John II]. By it any
contract or promise made by any person in order to obtain a Bishopric
is declared void.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<p>'Anyone refusing to refund money so received is to be declared guilty
of sacrilege, and restitution is to be enforced by the Judge.'</p>

<p>'Should a contention arise as to an election to the Apostolic See, and
the matter be brought to our Palace for decision, we direct that the
maximum fee to be paid, on the completion of the necessary documents
(?), shall be 3,000 solidi [&#163;1,800]<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>; but this is only to be
exacted from persons of sufficient ability to pay it.</p>

<p>'Patriarchs [Archbishops of the other great Italian Sees] under
similar circumstances are to pay not more than 2,000 solidi [&#163;1,200].</p>

<p>'No one is to give [on his consecration] more than 500 solidi [&#163;300]
to the poor.</p>

<p>'Anyone professing to obtain for money the suffrage of any one of our
servants on behalf of a candidate for Papacy or Patriarchate, shall be
forced to refund the money. If it cannot be recovered from him, it may
be from his heirs. He himself shall be branded with infamy.</p>

<p>'Should the giver of the money have been bound by such oaths, that,
without imperilling his soul, he cannot disclose the transaction,
anyone else may inform, and on establishing the truth of his
accusation, receive a third part of the money so corruptly paid, the
rest to go to the churches themselves, for the repair of the fabric or
for the daily ministry. Remember the fate of Simon Magus. We have
ordered that this decree be made known to the Senate and people by the
Praefect of the City.'</p>

<p>[I think the early part of this letter gives us the clue to the
pretext under which these simoniacal practices were introduced. It was
usual for the Pope on his elec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>tion to give a certain sum of money to
the poor. Then at a vehemently contested election certain of the
voters&#8212;perhaps especially the priests of the different <i>tituli</i> of
Rome&#8212;claimed to be distributors of the Papal bounty, a large part of
which they no doubt kept for themselves.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Release of two Roman citizens accused of sedition.</div>

<p>'We cannot bear that there should be sadness in Rome, the head of the
world. We hear with regret from the Apostolic Pope John, and other
nobles, that A and B, who are Romans, on a mere suspicion of sedition
are being macerated by so long imprisonment that the whole city mourns
for them; no gladness of a holyday and no respect for the Papal
name<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> (which is most dear to us) availing to mitigate their
confinement. This treatment of persons against whom no crime has been
proved distresses us much, and we admonish your Greatness, wherever
you may succeed in finding them, to set them free. If, confident in
their innocence, they think that they have been unjustly tormented, we
give them liberty to make their appeal to the laws. Judges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span> were
raised to their high estate, not to oppress but to defend the
innocent.</p>

<p>'Now let the Romans return to their ancient gladness; nor let them
think that any [rulers] please us but those who seek to act with
fairness and moderation. Let them understand that our forefathers
underwent labours and dangers that <i>they</i> might have rest; and that we
are expending large sums in order that they may rejoice with garrulous
exultation. For even if they have before now suffered some rough and
unjust treatment, let them not believe that that is a thing to be
neglected by our Mildness. No; for we give ourselves no rest, that
they may enjoy secure peace and calm gladness. Let them understand at
once that <i>we</i> cannot love the men whose excesses have made them
terrible to our subjects. Whose favour do those men expect to win who
have earned the dislike of their fellow-citizens? They might have
reaped a harvest of the public love, and instead thereof they have so
acted that their names are justly held in execration.'</p>


<h3><a name="ix18">18.</a> <span class="smcap">The Edict of Athalaric</span>.</h3>

<p>[This edict is minutely examined by Dahn ('K&#246;nige der Germanen' iv.
123-135). I have adopted his division of paragraphs, though rather
disposed to think that the 'De Donationibus' should be broken up into
two, to prevent counting the Epilogue as a section. See also Manso
('Geschichte der Ostrogothen' 405-415).]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edict of Athalaric.</div>

<p>'<i>Prologue.</i> This edict is a general one. No names are mentioned in
it, and those who are conscious of innocence need take no offence at
anything contained therein.</p>

<p>'For long an ominous whisper has reached our ears that certain
persons, despising <i>civilitas</i>, affect a life of beastly
barbarism<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>, returning to the wild beginnings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span> society, and
looking with a fierce hatred on all human laws. The present seems to
us a fitting time for repressing these men, in order that we may be
hunting down vice and immorality within the Republic at the same time
that, with God's help, we are resisting her external foes. Both are
hurtful, both have to be repelled; but the internal enemy is even more
dangerous than the external. One, however, rests upon the other; and
we shall more easily sweep down the armies of our enemies if we subdue
under us the vices of the age. [This allusion to foreign enemies is
perhaps explained by the hint in Jordanes ('De Reb. Get.' 59) of
threatened war with the Franks. But he gives us no sufficient
indication of time to enable us to fix the date of the Edictum.]</p>

<p>'I. <i>Forcible Appropriation of Landed Property</i><a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> (Pervasio). This
is a crime which is quite inconsistent with <i>civilitas</i>, and we remit
those who are guilty of it to the punishment<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> provided by a law of
Divus Valentinianus [Valentinian III. Novell. xix. 'De Invasoribus'],
adding that if anyone is unable to pay the penalty therein provided he
shall suffer banishment (deportatio). He ought to have been more chary
of disobeying the laws if he had no means to pay the penalty. Judges
who shrink from obeying this law, and allow the <i>Pervasor</i> to remain
in possession of what he has forcibly annexed, shall lose their
offices and be held liable to pay to our Treasury the same fine which
might have been exacted from him. If the <i>Pervasor</i> sets the Judge's
official staff (officium) at defiance, on the report of the Judge our
Sajones will make <i>him</i> feel the weight of the royal vengeance who
refused to obey the [humbler] <i>Cognitor</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p><p>'II. <i>Affixing Titles to Property.</i> [When land had from any cause
become public property, the Emperor's officers used to affix <i>tituli</i>,
to denote the fact and to warn off all other claimants. Powerful men
who had dispossessed weaker claimants used to imitate this practice,
and are here forbidden to do so.]</p>

<p>'This offence shall subject the perpetrator to the same penalties as
<i>pervasio</i>. It is really a kind of sacrilege to try to add the majesty
of the royal name to the weight of his own oppression. Costs are to be
borne by the defeated claimant.</p>

<p>'III. <i>Suppression of Words in a Decree.</i> Anyone obtaining a decree
against an adversary is to be careful to suppress nothing in the copy
which he serves upon him. If he does so, he shall lose all the
benefits that he obtained. We wish to help honest men, not rogues.</p>

<p>'IV. <i>Seduction of a Married Woman.</i> He who tries to interfere with
the married rights of another, shall be punished by inability to
contract a valid marriage himself. [This punishment of compulsory
celibacy is, according to Dahn, derived neither from Roman nor German
law, but is possibly due to Church influence.] The offender who has no
hope of present or future matrimony<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> shall be punished by
confiscation of half his property; or, if a poor man, by banishment.</p>

<p>'V. <i>Adultery</i>. All the statutes of the late King (divalis commonitio)
in this matter are to be strictly observed. [Edict. Theodorici, &#167; 38,
inflicted the penalty of death on both offenders and on the abettors
of the crime.]</p>

<p>'VI. <i>Bigamy</i> is to be punished with loss of all the offender's
property.</p>

<p>'VII. <i>Concubinage.</i> If a married man forms a connection of this kind
with a free woman, she and all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span> children shall become the slaves
of the injured wife. If with a woman who is a slave already, she shall
be subjected to any revenge that the lawful wife likes to inflict upon
her, short of blood-shedding<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>.</p>

<p>'VIII. <i>Donations</i> are not to be extorted by terror, nor acquired by
fraud, or as the price of immorality. Where a gift is <i>bon&#226; fide</i>, the
document conveying it is to be drawn up with the strictness prescribed
by Antiquity, in order to remove occasions of fraud.</p>

<p>'IX. Magicians and other persons practising nefarious arts are to be
punished by the severity of the laws. What madness to leave the Giver
of life and seek to the Author of death! Let the Judges be especially
careful to avoid the contagion of these foul practices.</p>

<p>'X. <i>Violence Exercised towards the Weak.</i> Let the condition of
mediocrity be safe from the arrogance of the rich. Let the madness of
bloodshed be avoided. To take the law into your own hands is to wage
private war, especially in the case of those who are fortified by the
authority of our <i>tuitio</i>. If anyone attempts with foul presumption to
act contrary to these principles, let him be considered a violator of
our orders.</p>

<p>'XI. <i>Appeals</i> are not to be made twice in the same cause.</p>

<p>'XII. <i>Epilogue.</i> But lest, while touching on a few points, we should
be thought not to wish the laws to be observed in other matters, we
declare that all the edicts of ourself and of our lord and
grandfather, which were confirmed by venerable deliberation<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>, and
the whole body of decided law<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>, be adhered to with the utmost
rigour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p><p>'And these laws are so scrupulously guarded that our own oath is
interposed for their defence. Why enlarge further? Let the usual rule
of law and the honest intent of our precepts be everywhere observed.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Promulgation of the Edict.</div>

<p>'Good laws are called forth by evil manners. If no complaints were
ever heard, the Prince might take holiday. Stirred up by many and
frequent complaints of our people, we have drawn up certain
regulations necessary for the Roman peace, in our edict which is
divided into twelve chapters, after the manner of the civil law<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>.
We do not thereby abrogate, but rather confirm, the previously
existing body of law.</p>

<p>'Let this edict be read in your splendid assembly, and exhibited for
thirty days by the Praefect of the City in the most conspicuous
places. Thus shall our <i>civilitas</i> be recognised, and truculent men
lose their confidence. What insolent subjects<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> can indulge in
violence when the Sovereign condemns it? Our armies fight that there
may be peace at home. Let the Judges do their duty fearlessly, and
avoid foul corruption.'</p>


<h3><a name="ix20">20.</a> <span class="smcap">King Athalaric to all the Judges of the Provinces</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The same subject.</div>

<p>'It is vexatious that, though we appoint you year by year to your
duties, and leave no district without its Judge, there is yet such
tardiness in administering justice that suitors come by preference to
our distant Court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>'To take away all excuse from you, and relieve the necessity of our
subjects, we have drawn up an edict which we desire you to exhibit for
thirty days in the wonted manner at all places of public meeting.'</p>


<h3><a name="ix21">21.</a> <span class="smcap">King Athalaric to the Senate of the City of Rome</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Increase of salaries of grammarians.</div>

<p>'You who are called Fathers should be interested in all that concerns
the education of your sons. We hear by certain whisperings that the
teachers of eloquence at Rome are not receiving their proper reward,
and that the sums appointed to be paid to the masters of schools are
lessened by the haggling of some persons.</p>

<p>'Grammar is the noble foundation of all literature, the glorious
mother of eloquence. As a virtuous man is offended by any act of vice,
as a musician is pained by a discordant note, so does the grammarian
in a moment perceive a false concord.</p>

<p>'The grammatical art is not used by barbarous kings: it abides
peculiarly with legitimate sovereigns<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>. Other nations have arms:
the lords of the Romans alone have eloquence. Hence sounds the trumpet
for the legal fray in the Forum. Hence comes the eloquence of so many
chiefs of the State. Hence, to say nothing more, even this discourse
which is now addressed to you<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>.</p>

<p>'Wherefore let the teacher of grammar and of rhetoric, if he be found
suitable for his work and obey the decrees of the Praefect of the
City, be supported by your authority, and suffer no diminution of his
salary<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>.</p>

<p>'To prevent his being dependent in any way on the caprice of his
employer, let him receive half his salary at the end of half a year,
and his <i>annonae</i> at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span> customary times. If the person whose
business it is to pay him neglects this order, he shall be charged
interest on the arrears.</p>

<p>'The Grammarian is a man to whom every hour unemployed is misery, and
it is a shame that such a man should have to wait the caprice of a
public functionary before he gets his pay. We provide for the salaries
of the play-actors, who minister only to the amusement of the public;
and how much more for these men, the moulders of the style and
character of our youth! Therefore let them henceforward not have to
try the philosophical problem of thinking about two things at once,
but, with their minds at ease about their subsistence, devote
themselves with all their vigour to the teaching of liberal arts.'</p>


<h3><a name="ix22">22.</a> <span class="smcap">King Athalaric to Paulinus, Vir Clarissimus and Consul</span> (533).</h3>

<p>[Flavius Theodoras Paulinus Junior was Consul with the Emperor
Justinian in 534. This letter was written in Sept. 533, about thirteen
months before the death of Athalaric. Paulinus was son of Venantius
and grandson of Liberius.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paulinus chosen as Consul.</div>

<p>'The absent from our Court need not fear that they will be disregarded
in the distribution of honours, especially when they are sprung from
an illustrious stock, the offspring of the Senate.</p>

the Decii, who, in a great crisis, alone saved their country.</p>

<p>'Take then for the twelfth Indiction the ensigns of the
Consulship<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>. It is an arduous honour, but one which your family is
well used to. The Fasti are studded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span> its names, and nearly all
the Senate is of kin to you. Still, presume not too much on the merits
of your ancestors, but rather seek to emulate their noble deeds.'</p>


<h3><a name="ix23">23.</a> <span class="smcap">King Athalaric to the Senate of the City of Rome</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">On the Consulship of Paulinus.</div>

<p>'Judge of our esteem for your honourable body, Conscript Fathers,
when, without any hesitation, we appoint your sons whom we have never
seen to high office, because they are your sons.</p>

<p>'We admire the Patrician Venantius, blessed as he has been with such
an abundant progeny, and found equal to the weight of so many
Consulships. His sons have been all temperate and lively; worthy
members of the same distinguished family. They have been trained in
arms, their minds have been formed by letters, their bodies by the
exercises of the gymnasium. They have learned to show constancy to
their friends, loyalty to their lords; and they have succeeded to the
virtues of their ancestors, as they will to their patrimony. Wisely
husbanding his own fortune, Venantius has been able to support the
honour&#8212;gratifying, but burdensome&#8212;of seeing so many of his sons made
Consuls. But this is an honour not strange to his family, sprung from
the ancient Decii. His hall is full of laurelled Fasces, and in his
line one might almost say that each one is born a Consular.</p>

<p>'Favour our candidate then, Conscript Fathers, and cherish him with
that care which the name of your body<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> signifies.'</p>

<p>'If you had been hitherto an obscure person we might feel some doubt
how you would bear yourself in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span> new office, but your long and
glorious career under our grandfather relieves us from any such
anxieties. <i>His</i> choice of you is a thing to be not discussed but
reverently accepted. It was by him that we ourselves were chosen; and
the Divine favour so conspicuously followed him that no General whom
he selected was other than victorious, no Judge whom he appointed was
other than just. In short, one might almost deem him to have been
endowed with the gift of prophecy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Quaestorship.</div>

<p>'In your early manhood he received you into the office of Quaestor,
and soon found you to be a conscientious man, learned in the law
beyond your years<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>. You were the chief ornament of your times,
inasmuch as you, by your blameless service sustaining the weight of
that royal intellect by all the force of your eloquence, enabled him,
with his keen interest in all public affairs, to await the result with
confidence. In you he possessed a counsellor pleasant in the
transaction of business, rigid in his sense of justice, free from all
taint of avarice. You never fixed a scandalous tariff for the sale of
his benefits; and thus you reaped your reward in a wealth of public
opinion, not in gold. It was because that just Prince proved you to be
averse from all these vices that he selected you for his glorious
friendship. A wise judge, he threw upon you the weight of listening to
the arguments of contending parties; and so high was his opinion of
your tried sagacity that he at once uttered your decision as the
greatest benefit that he could confer on the litigants. How often did
he rank you among the oldest chiefs of his Council! How often was it
seen that your young beginnings were more than a match for them, who
had the experience of long years behind them! What he found to praise
in you was your excellent disposition, wide open for useful work,
tight closed against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span> the vices of avarice. Whereas, for some reason,
it is rare to find amongst men, the hand closed and justice open.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His career as Master of the Offices.</div>

<p>'Let us pass on to the dignity of <i>Magister Officiorum</i>, which all men
knew that you obtained, not from the reputation of wealth, but as a
testimony to your character. In this place you were always ready to
help the [successive] Quaestors; for, when pure eloquence was
required, the case was always put in your hands. The benignant
Sovereign claimed from you the fulfilment of duties which he knew that
he had not formally laid upon you; and such was the favour that he had
for you, while others laboured you received the reward of his abundant
praises<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>. For under your administration no dignity kept its exact
limits; anything that was to be honestly done by all the chiefs of the
State together, you considered to be entrusted to <i>your</i> conscience
for its performance.</p>

<p>'No one found occasion to murmur anything to your disadvantage, though
you had to bear all the weight of unpopularity which comes from the
Sovereign's favour. The integrity of your life conquered those who
longed to detract from your reputation, and your enemies were obliged
to utter the praises which their hearts abhorred; for even malice
leaves manifest goodness unattacked, lest it be itself exposed to
general hatred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His friendship for Theodoric.</div>

<p>'To the Monarch you showed yourself a friendly Minister and an
intimate Noble<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>. For when he had laid aside the cares of State, he
would seek in your conversation the opinions of wise men of old, that
by his own deeds he might make himself equal to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span> ancients<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>.
Into the courses of the stars, into the gulfs of the sea, into the
marvels of springing fountains, this most acute questioner enquired,
so that by his diligent investigations into the nature of things he
seemed to be a Philosopher wearing the purple.</p>

<p>'It were long to narrate all your merits in the past. Let us rather
turn to the future, and show how the heir of Theodoric's Empire
proposes to pay the debts of Theodoric.</p>

<p>'Therefore, with the Divine help, we bestow on you from the twelfth
Indiction [Sept. 1, 533] the authority and insignia of Praetorian
Praefect. Let the Provinces, which we know to have been hitherto
wearied by the administration of dishonest men, fearlessly receive a
Judge of tried integrity.</p>

<p>'Though you have before you the example of your father's
Praefecture<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>, renowned throughout the Italian world, we do not so
much set before you either that or any other example, as your own past
character, exhorting you to rule consistently with that. You have
always been averse from bribery; now earnestly help the victims of
injustice. We have purposely delayed your accession to this high
office that you might be the more heartily welcomed by the people, who
expected to see you clothed with it long ago. Diligently seek out
anything belonging to the titles of the Praetorian Praefecture, of
which it has been defrauded by the cupidity of others. We send you as

<div class="sidenote">Eulogy of Cassiodorus on his appointment as Praetorian
Praefect.</div>

<p>'We have loaded Senator with our benefits, Conscript Fathers, because
he abounds in virtue, is rich in excellence of character, and is
already full of the highest honours. But, in fact, we are his debtors.
How shall we repay that eloquent tongue of his, with which he set
forth the deeds of the Prince, till he himself who had wrought them
wondered at his story? In praising the reign of the wearer of the
purple, he made it acceptable to your nation. For taxes may be paid to
a tyrant; praise, such as this, is given only to a good Prince.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Gothic History.</div>

<p>'Not satisfied with extolling living Kings, from whom he might hope
for a reward, he drew forth the Kings of the Goths from the dust of
ages, showing that the Amal family had been royal for seventeen
generations, and proved that the origin of the Gothic people belonged
to Roman history<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>, adorning the whole subject with the flowers of
his learning gathered from wide fields of literature.</p>

<p>'In the early days of our reign what labour he gave to the settling of
our affairs! He was alone sufficient for all. The duty of making
public harangues, our own private counsels, required him. He laboured
that the Empire might rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">His official career.</div>

<p>'We found him Magister; but he discharged the duties of Quaestor, and
willingly bestowed on us, the heir, the experience which he had gained
in the counsels of our grandfather.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His military services.</div>

<p>'And not only so, he helped the beginning of our reign both with his
arms and his pen. For when the care of our shores<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> occupied our
royal meditation, he suddenly emerged from the seclusion of his
cabinet, boldly, like his ancestors, assumed the office of
General<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>, and triumphed by his character when there was no enemy
to overcome. For he maintained the Gothic warriors<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> at his own
charges, so that there should be no robbery of the Provincials on the
one hand, no too heavy burden on the exchequer on the other. Thus was
the soldier what he ought to be, the true defender, not the ravager of
his country. Then when the time for victualling the ships was over,
and the war was laid aside, he shone as an administrator rather than a
warrior, healing, without injury to the litigants, the various suits
which arose out of the sudden cessation of the contracts<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>.</p>

<p>'Such was the glory of the military command of a Metellus in Asia, of
a Cato in Spain&#8212;a glory far more durable than any that can be derived
from the varying shock of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His religious character.</div>

<p>'Yet with all these merits, how humble he has been, how modest, how
benevolent, how slow to wrath, how generous in the distribution of
that which is his own,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span> how slow to covet the property of others! All
these virtues have been consolidated by his reading of the Divine
Book, the fear of God helping him to triumph over baser, human
motives. Thus has he been rendered humble towards all, as one imbued
with heavenly teaching.</p>

<p>'Him therefore, Conscript Fathers, we make, under God's blessing,
Praetorian Praefect from the twelfth Indiction [Sept. 1, 533], that he
may repress by his own loyalty the trafficking of knaves, and may use
his power for the good of the Republic, bequeathing eternal renown to
his posterity.'</p>

<p>'It is usual for newly-crowned Kings to signify their accession to the
different nations round them. I, in making this communication to you,
am greatly favoured by Providence, feeling secure of your favour,
because I know that my most excellent Lady and Sister has already
attained it. I feel confident that I shall justify the choice of one
who shines in such a light of wisdom that she both governs her own
kingdom with admirable forethought and keeps firmly the vows of
friendship which she has plighted to her neighbours. Partner of her
cares, I desire also to be a partner of her wisely-formed friendships,
those especially which she has contracted with you, who have nothing
like unto you in the whole world. This alliance is no new thing: if
you will look back upon the deeds of our ancestors you will find that
there is a custom which has obtained the force of a law, that the
Amals should be friendly with the Empire. So old a friendship is
likely to endure; and if, in obedience to it and to my Sister's
choice, I have your love, I shall feel that I am indeed a King.</p>

<h3><a name="x3">3.</a> <span class="smcap">Queen Amalasuentha to the Senate of the City of Rome</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The same subject.</div>

<p>'After the death of our son of blessed memory<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> our love for the
common weal overcame the yearnings of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span> mother's heart and caused us
to seek your prosperity rather than an opportunity to indulge in our
own sorrow. We have considered by what solace we should strengthen
ourselves for the cares of royalty. The same Providence which has
deprived us of a son in the dawn of manhood, has reserved for us the
affection of a brother in mature age. Under the Divine auspices we
have chosen Theodahad<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> as the fortunate partner of our throne. We
two, with conjoined counsels, shall now labour for the common welfare,
<i>two</i> in our meditations, <i>one</i> in the action which results from them.
The stars give one another mutual help in ruling the heavens, and God
has bestowed on man two hands, two ears, two eyes, that each one of
these members should assist the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Praises of Theodahad.</div>

<p>'Therefore exult, Conscript Fathers, and commend our deed to the
blessing of the Almighty. Our sharing our power with another is a
pledge of its being wisely and gently exercised. By God's help we have
opened our palace to a man of our own race, conspicuous by his
illustrious position, who, born of the Amal stock, has a kingly
dignity in all his actions, being patient in adversity, moderate in
prosperity, and, most difficult of all kinds of government, long used
to the government of himself. Moreover, he possesses that desirable
quality, literary erudition, lending a grace to a nature originally
praiseworthy. It is in books that the sage counsellor finds deeper
wisdom, in books that the warrior learns how he may be strengthened by
the courage of the soul, in books that the Sovereign discovers how he
may weld nations together under his equal rule. In short, there is no
condition in life the credit whereof is not augmented by the glorious
knowledge of literature.</p>

<p>'Your new Sovereign is moreover learned in ecclesiastical lore, by
which we are ever reminded of the things which make for our own true
honour, right judgment, wise discretion, reverence for God, thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
of the future judgment. For the remembrance that we shall one day
stand at the bar to answer for ourselves compels us to follow the
footprints of Justice. Thus does religious reading not only sharpen
the intellect but ever tend to make men scrupulous in the performance
of their duties.</p>

<p>'Let me pass on to that most generous frugality of his private
household<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> which procured the means of such abundance in his
gifts, of such plenty at his banquets, that even the kingdom will not
call for any new expenditure in this respect greater than the old.
Generous in his hospitality, most pitiful in his compassions, while he
was thus spending much, his fortune, by a heavenly reward, was ever on
the increase.</p>

<p>'The wish of the people should coincide with our choice of such a man,
who, reasonably spending his own goods, does not desire the goods of
others<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>. For moderation in his own expenditure takes away from the
Sovereign the temptation to transgress the precepts of justice and to
abandon the golden mean.</p>

<p>'Rejoice then, Conscript Fathers, and give thanks to the Most High,
that I have chosen such a ruler, who will supplement my justice by the
good deeds which spring from his own piety. For this man is both
admonished by the virtue of his ancestors and powerfully stimulated by
the example of his uncle Theodoric.'</p>


<h3><a name="x4">4.</a> <span class="smcap">King Theodahad to the Senate of the City of Rome</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The same subject.</div>

<p>'We announce to you, Conscript Fathers, the Divine favour which has
been manifested unto us, in that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span> sovereign Lady<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>, who is
renowned throughout the whole world, has with generous affection made
me partaker of her throne, so that she may not lack loyal support and
I may be fittingly clothed with the purple of my ancestors.</p>

<p>'I know that this elevation of mine was the object of the wishes of
the community. Your whispers in my favour might have been a source of
danger, but now your openly expressed acclamations are my proudest
boast. You wished that God should bestow upon me this honour, to which
I for my part should not have ventured to aspire. But if I have, as I
trust I have, any influence with you, let me prevail upon you to join
with me in perpetually hymning the glorious praises of our Lady and
Sister. She has wished to strengthen the greatness of our Empire by
associating me therein, even as the two eyes of a man harmoniously
co-operate towards a single act of vision. Divine grace joins us
together: our near relationship cements our friendship. Persons of
diverse character may find it an arduous matter thus to work in
common; but, to those who resemble one another in the goodness of
their intentions, the difficulty would rather be <i>not</i> to work in
harmony. The man devoid of forethought may fear the changing of his
purposes; but he who is really great in wisdom eagerly seeks wisdom in
another.</p>

<p>'But of all the gifts which with this regal dignity the Divine favour
has bestowed upon me, none pleases me more than the fact that I should
have been thus chosen by that wisest Lady who is herself a moral
balance of the utmost delicacy, and who made me first feel her justice
before advancing me to this high dignity. For, as you know, she
ordained that I should plead my cause against private persons in the
common judgment-hall<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>. Oh wonderful nobility of her mind! Oh
admir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>able justice, which the world may well tell of! She hesitated
not first to subject her own relation to the course of public justice,
even him whom, a little after, she would raise above the laws
themselves. She thoroughly searched the conscience of him to whom she
was about to hand over the dignity of kingship, that she might be
recognised as sovereign Lady of all, and that I, when tested, might be
advanced by her to the throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Praises of Amalasuentha.</div>

<p>'When shall I be able to repay her for all these favours: her who,
having reigned alone during the minority of her son, now chooses me as
the partner of her realm? In her is the glory of all kingdoms, the
flower of all our family. All our splendour is derived from her, and
she reflects a lustre not only on our ancestors, but on the whole
human race. Her dutiful affection, her weight of character, who can
set forth? The philosophers would learn new lessons if they knew her,
and would acknowledge that their books fail to describe all her
attributes. Acute she is in her powers of reasoning; but with royal
taciturnity she knows how to veil her conclusions in secrecy. She is
mistress of many languages; and her intellect, if suddenly tested, is
found so ready for the trial that it scarcely seems like that of a
mortal. In the Books of Kings the Queen of the South is said to have
come to learn the wisdom of Solomon: but here a woman speaks, and
Sovereigns listen to her with admiration. Infinite depths of meaning
are fathomed by her in few words, and she, with utmost ease, expresses
what others can only after long deliberation embody in language<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>
<p>'Happy the commonwealth which boasts the guidance of such a mistress.
It was not enough that already liberty and convenience were combined
for the multitude<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>: her merits have secured the fitting reverence
for the person of the Sovereign. In obeying <i>her</i> we obey all the
virtues. I, too, with such a counsellor, fear not the weight of the
crown; and I know that whatever is strange to me in my new duties I
shall learn from her as the safest of teachers.</p>

<p>'Acknowledge, noble Sirs, that all my power of increased usefulness to
the State comes from this our most wise Lady, from whom I may either
gain wisdom by asking questions, or virtue by following her example.</p>

<p>'Live happily: live in harmony by God's help, and emulate that grace
of concord which you see prevailing between your Sovereigns.'</p>

character, and we find in you that love of justice which is all
important in a representative of the Prince. Then we look at the
qualities of your intellect, and we find in you that flow of eloquence
which among all mental accomplishments we value most highly. What does
it profit to be a philosopher, if one cannot worthily set forth the
results of one's investigations? To discover is natural to man; but to
set forth one's discoveries in noble language, that is indeed a

<div class="sidenote">The same subject.</div>

<p>'After announcing to you our own accession, one of our first cares was
to choose a Judge whose style of speaking might dignify the State.
Such a Judge have we found in Patricius (Patrician by his name
already), whom we hereby appoint to the office of Quaestor. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
studied eloquence at Rome. Where could he have studied better? For
while other parts of the world have their wine, their balm, their
frankincense, which they can export, the peculiar product of Rome is
eloquence.</p>

<p>'Having thus learned his art, he practised it at the bar with singular
moderation. No heat of strife hurried him into abuse of his
competitors. Seeking only to win his client's cause, he calmly and
courteously set forth that client's rights without sacrificing his own
dignity of demeanour.</p>

<p>'Thinking that this man has pleaded long enough, we now appoint that
he shall sit as Judge, having made diligent enquiry as to his
character. In this, and in all other matters, we wish to follow the

<div class="sidenote">Summons to Ravenna. Suspicions of the Senators.</div>

<p>'After we had dismissed the venerable Bishops who brought your
message, without taking exception to your requests, though there were
some things blameworthy among them, we received tidings that the City
of Rome was agitated by certain foolish anxieties, from which real
evil would grow unless the suspicion which caused them could be laid
to rest.</p>

<p>'I fear that I cannot complain of &quot;popular levity&quot; if your illustrious
body, which should set an example to all others, should give way to
such fond imaginings. If Rome, which should govern the Provinces, be
so foolish, what can we expect of <i>them</i>?</p>

<p>'Divine grace, however, prompts us both to pardon your faults and to
grant your requests. We owe you nothing, and yet we pay you<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>; but
we trust to be rewarded by hearing not our own praises but yours. Put
away these unworthy, these childish suspicions, and behave as becomes
the fathers of the people.</p>

<p>'In desiring your presence at our Court, we sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span> not your vexation
but your advantage. It is certainly a great privilege to see the face
of the Sovereign, and we thought to bestow on you, for the advantage
of the State, that which used to be counted as a reward. However, not
to deal harshly with you, we shall be satisfied with the attendance of
certain individuals from your body, as occasion may require, so that
on the one hand Rome may not be denuded of her citizens, and on the
other that we may not lack prudent counsellors in our chamber. Now
return to your old devotion, and serve us, not as a matter of fear,
but of love. The rest shall the bearer of this letter explain unto
you.'</p>

<p>[The occasion of writing this letter, which we may perhaps refer to
the early part of 535, is apparently that some Gothic troops have been
sent to Rome, and the people have broken out into clamours against
them, or petitioned for their removal.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissensions between citizens of Rome and Gothic troops.</div>

<p>'Your predecessors have always been distinguished by the loyal love
which they bore to the Chief of the State; and it is only right that
he [the Sovereign] who is defended with so much toil, he, for whom, as
the representative of public order, daily precautions are taken<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>,
should in return love that people above all others whose loyalty gives
him a right to rule the world<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>.</p>

<p>'Oh! let there be nothing in you in our days which may justly move our
indignation. Still show forth your older loyalty. It is not fitting
that the Roman people should be fickle, or crafty, or full of
seditions.</p>

<p>'Let no fond suspicions, no shadow of fear sway you. You have a
Sovereign who only longs to find opportunities to love you. Meet with
hostile arms your enemies, not your own defenders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p>

<p>'You ought to have invited, not to have shut out the succour which we
sent you. Evidently you have been misled by counsellors who care not
for the public weal. Return to your own better minds.</p>

<p>'Was it some new and strange nation whose faces forsooth thus
terrified you? No: the very men whom hitherto you have called your
kinsmen, the men who in their anxiety for your safety have left their
homes and families in order to defend you. Strange return on your part
for their devotion!</p>

<p>'As for you, you should know this, that night and day our one
ceaseless desire is to perfect, with God's help, the security which
was fostered in the times of our relations [Theodoric and
Amalasuentha]. Where, indeed, would our credit as a Sovereign be if
anything happened to your hurt? Dismiss all such thoughts from your
minds. If any have been unjustly cast down, we will raise him up
again. We have sent you some verbal messages by the bearer of this
letter, and hope that from henceforth we may rely on your constant
obedience.'</p>

<p>'Anxious that what we are devising for your safety should not be

which is marching to Rome is intended for your defence, in order that
they who covet your possessions may by Divine help be resisted by the
arms of the Goths. If the shepherd is bound to watch over his flock,

defence of the City may be in no wise burdensome to you, we have
ordered that the soldiers shall pay at the ordinary market rate for
the provisions which they require; and we have desired Vacco, the
steward of our house, to superintend these purchases. He is a man of
valour and integrity, whose character will secure him the obedience of
the troops, and enable him to prevent any excesses.</p>

<p>'We thank the Divine Being, who loves to see Kings at peace with one
another, that you expressed such joy at our elevation to the throne.
Continue to set to the world this example of benignity; continue to
show your interest in one who recommends himself by his pure affection
for you. For you do not seek to pick shabby quarrels with other
Sovereigns; you do not delight in unjust contests, which are contrary
to sound morality<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>, since you seek for nothing but what may

even on angry nations<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>?</p>

<p>'Even you, glorious Sovereigns! [Justinian and Theodora] gain somewhat
when all other realms revere you. It is a common thing for the ruler
to be praised in his own land, but to receive the unforced praise of
foreign lands, that is indeed desirable. You are loved, most pious
Emperor, in your own dominions; but how much grander a thing to be yet
more loved in the regions of Italy, from whence the glory of the Roman
name was diffused over the whole world! It behoves you therefore to
continue that peaceful disposition which you showed towards us at the
commencement of our reign.</p>

<p>'We have desired the most blessed Pope and the most honourable Senate
of the City of Rome to give their answers to the eloquent and worthy

<p>[It is clear that this letter refers to an office greatly coveted, and
one in which there was a possibility of making great gains, but also
one in which, owing to the regulation of prices by the government,
there might be temporary losses; to guard against which it was
considered reasonable that the holder should be guaranteed in his
office for five years.</p>

<p>The office is the supply of the staple articles of food to the King's
household at Rome and Ravenna, and to the garrisons probably of Pavia
and Piacenza and the neighbouring country. Did this right carry with
it an absolute monopoly as far as the other inhabitants of those
places are concerned? This seems probable; but I do not know that we
can positively state it.</p>

<p>The term used, 'Arcarii,' is applied in the Theodosian Code (xii. 6,
14) to the bailiffs by whom the rents on the Imperial domain were
collected. Here it has manifestly altered its meaning.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">An old soldier receives furlough for a visit to the baths
of Bormio.</div>

<p>'Your noble birth and tried fidelity induced us to commit to you the
government of the City of Ticinum, which you had defended in war: but
now, being deluged with a sudden inundation of muddy gout<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>, you
ask leave to resort to the waters of Bormio, which by their drying
influences are of healing power for this malady.</p>

<p>'We permit, nay earnestly encourage, you to undertake this journey;
for we cannot bear that one of our warriors should fall a victim to
the tyranny of this cruel disease, which, like the Barbarians, when it
has once claimed by force hospitality in the owner's body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span> ever after
defends its right thereto by cruelty. It seeks out all the hollow
places of the system, makes stones out of its moisture, and deposits
them there, destroying all the beautiful arrangements of Nature for
free and easy movement. It loosens what ought to be tight, it
contracts the nerves, and so shortens the limbs that a tall man finds
all the comeliness of his stature taken from him while he is still
unmutilated. It is in truth a living death; and when the excruciating
torment is gone, it leaves an almost worse legacy behind it&#8212;inability
to move. Even debtors in the torture chamber have the weights
sometimes removed from their feet; but this cruel malady, when it has
once taken hold of a man, seems never to relinquish possession. A
disease of this kind, bringing with it weakness and helplessness, is
especially terrible to a warrior, who after overcoming the foes that
came against him in battle, finds himself thus struck down by an enemy
within.</p>

<p>'Go then, in Heaven's name, to the healing springs. We cannot bear the
thought that you the warrior should be carried on men's shoulders,
instead of bestriding your war-horse. We have painted all these evils
in somewhat exaggerated style in order to stir you up to seek an early
cure.</p>

<p>'Use then these waters, soothing to the taste, and in the hot bath
able to dry up the gouty humours. God has given us this ally wherewith
to overcome that enemy of the human race; and under its double
influence, within and without, the malady, which ten years of regimen
and endless medicines cannot lessen, is put to flight by remedies
which are in themselves delightful.</p>

<p>'May God grant that this far-famed place may restore your body to

<div class="sidenote">The elephants in the Via Sacra.</div>

<p>'We regret to learn from your report that the brazen elephants placed
in the Via Sacra<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> (so called from the many superstitions to which
it was consecrated of old) are falling into ruins.</p>

<p>'This is to be much regretted, that whereas these animals live in the
flesh more than a thousand years, their brazen effigies should be so
soon crumbling away. See therefore that their gaping limbs be
strengthened by iron hooks, and that their drooping bellies be
fortified by masonry placed underneath them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural history of the elephant.</div>

<p>'The living elephant, when it is prostrate on the ground, as it often
is when helping men to fell trees, cannot get up again unaided. This
is because it has no joints in its feet; and accordingly you see
numbers of them lying as if dead till men come to help them up again.
Thus this creature, so terrible by its size, is really not equally
endowed by Nature with the tiny ant.</p>

<p>'That the elephant surpasses all other animals in intelligence is
proved by the adoration which it renders to Him whom it understands to
be the Almighty Ruler of all. Moreover it pays to good princes a
homage which it refuses to tyrants.</p>

<p>'It uses its proboscis<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>, that nos&#235;d hand which Nature has given it
to compensate for its very short neck, for the benefit of its master,
accepting the presents which will be profitable to him. It always
walks cautiously, mindful of that fatal fall [into the hunter's pit]
which was the beginning of its captivity. At its master's bidding it
exhales its breath, which is said to be a remedy for the human
headache.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>
<p>'When it comes to water it sucks up in its trunk a vast quantity,
which at the word of command it squirts forth like a shower. If anyone
have treated it with contempt, it pours forth such a stream of dirty
water over him that one would think a river had entered his house. For
this beast has a wonderfully long memory, both of injury and of
kindness. Its eyes are small, but move solemnly. There is a sort of
kingly dignity in its appearance, and while it recognises with
pleasure all that is honourable, it seems to despise scurrilous jests.
Its skin is furrowed by deep channels, like that of the victims of the
foreign disease named after it<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>, <i>elephantiasis</i>. It is on account
of the impenetrability of this hide that the Persian Kings used the
elephant in war.</p>

<p>'It is most desirable that we should preserve the images of these
creatures, and that our citizens should thus be familiarised with the
sight of the denizens of foreign lands. Do not therefore permit them
to perish, since it is for the glory of Rome to collect all specimens
of the process by which the art of workmen hath imitated the
productions of wealthy Nature in all parts of the world.'</p>

<p>[This letter traverses the same ground as Pliny's 'Historia Naturalis'
viii. 1-11, but supplies some new facts. Pliny makes the elephant live
to the age of 200 or even 300 years. Cassiodorus boldly says 'more
than a thousand.' The curious story of the elephant's religion is
given with more detail by Pliny; but he knows nothing of the political
sagacity which enables it to discern between a good king and a tyrant.
Pliny mentions the fact that the elephant's breath is a cure for
headache, but adds, 'especially if he sneeze<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>.'</p>

<p>Upon the whole, though Cassiodorus had probably read Pliny's
description, his own must be pronounced original.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Elevation of Witigis.</div>

<p>'Though every advance in station is to be accounted among the good
gifts of the Divinity, especially is the kingly dignity to be looked
upon as coming by His ordinance through Whom kings reign and subjects
obey. Wherefore, with liveliest satisfaction returning thanks to our
Maker Christ, we inform you that our kinsmen<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> the Goths, amid a
fence of circling swords, raising us in ancestral fashion upon a
shield, have by Divine guidance bestowed on us the kingly dignity,
thus making arms the emblem of honour to one who has earned all his
renown in war. For know that not in the corner of a presence-chamber,
but in wide-spreading plains I have been chosen King; and that not the
dainty discourse of flatterers, but the blare of trumpets announced my
elevation, that the Gothic people, roused by the sound to a kindling
of their inborn valour, might once more gaze upon a Soldier King.</p>

<p>'Too long indeed have these brave men, bred up amid the shock of
battle, borne with a Sovereign who was untried in war; too long have
they laboured to uphold his dubious fame, though they might presume
upon their own well-known valour<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>. For it is inevitable that the
character of the ruler should in some degree influence the reputation
of the whole people.</p>

<p>'But, as ye have heard, called forth by the dangers of my kindred, I
was ready to undergo with them one common fate; but they would not
suffer me to continue a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span> mere General, feeling that they needed a
veteran King. Wherefore now accept first the Divine decree, and then
the judgment of the Goths, since it is your unanimous wish which makes
me King. Lay aside then the fear of disaster: cast off the suspicion
of further losses: fear no rude strokes of fate under our dominion. We
who have ridden so oft to war have learned to love valiant men.
Associated in all things with your labours, I have been myself a
witness to the brave deeds of each of you, and need no other evidence
of your worth. By no fraudulent variations between my public and
private negotiations shall the might of the Gothic arms be
broken<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>. Everything that we do shall have respect to the welfare
of our whole people: in private we will not even love. We promise to
follow those courses which shall adorn the royal name. Finally, we
undertake that our rule shall in all things be such as becomes a
Gothic King, the successor of the renowned Theodoric&#8212;that man who was
so rarely and so nobly qualified by Nature for the cares of royalty;
that man of whom it may be truly said that every other Sovereign is
illustrious in so far as he loves <i>his</i> counsels. Therefore he who
succeeds in imitating the deeds of Theodoric ought to be considered as
belonging to his line. Thus then, manifest your anxious care for the
welfare of our kingdom, while your hearts are at ease, through God's
goodness, as to our internal security.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Overtures for peace with the Empire.</div>

<p>'How much, oh most clement Emperor, we long for the sweetness of your
favour, may be understood from this fact alone, that after such
serious injuries and such grievous bloodshed as you have inflicted on
us, we still come forward to ask for peace with you, as if none of
your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span> servants had ever wronged us. We have suffered such things as
might move the indignation even of our enemies, who must know that
they have attacked us without our guilt, have hated us without our
fault, have despoiled us without our owing them anything. Nor can it
be said that the blow has been so slight that no account need be taken
of it, since it has been struck not in the Provinces alone but in Rome
[or Italy] herself, the Capital of the World<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>. Think how great
must be our pain at this, which nevertheless we banish from memory in
order that we may obtain justice at your hands. Such disturbance has
been made as the whole world speaks of<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> [and condemns], and it
deserves to be so composed by you that all men may admire your spirit
of equity.</p>

<p>'If vengeance on King Theodahad be the thing required, I [who have put
him to death] merit your love. If you desire to honour the blessed
memory of Queen Amalasuentha, think of her daughter<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>, who has
reached [by our means] that royal station to which your soldiers might
well have striven to exalt her, in order that all the nations might
see how faithful you remained to the old friendship.</p>

<p>'This fact too ought to influence you, that by the ordering of
Providence we were permitted to make your acquaintance before our
accession to the throne, that the remembrance of our favourable
reception at your Court, and the sight of your person in that splendid
position, might move us to love and reverence.</p>

<p>'Even now you can undo all that has been misdone, since the continual
expectation of favours to come, makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span> perseverance in affection
easy<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>. Therefore, soliciting your Clemency with all due respect,
we inform you that we have appointed A and B our ambassadors to the
Wisdom of your Serenity, that you may, according to your custom, duly
weigh all these considerations, that the two Republics may persevere
in restored harmony, and that all which hath been settled in past
times by Sovereigns of blessed memory may, by God's help, be increased
and made more prosperous under your dominion.</p>

your prudence support our reasonable requests with the Emperor. You
can easily correct those things [the war against the Gothic people]
which you ought never to have allowed to take place; and all things
can now be arranged in the most friendly manner, since a
reconciliation between men who have fought out their quarrel is often
the surest ground of friendship. An unknown man might possibly have
been shunned by you; but I, who have seen the magnificence of your
Republic, who have known the hearts of so many of your noble
statesmen, have no desire to quarrel with your most pious Emperor, if
he will only cherish thoughts of justice towards me. If another
[Theodahad] deserved the anger of the Emperor, I ought to be looked
upon with the highest favour, who have executed vengeance on that
hateful predecessor. I have carried your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span> intentions into effect, and
therefore I deserve reward, not punishment. Let all hatred be buried
in the grave of the sinner; and even if you think nothing of our
deservings, think of the liberty of the Romans, which is everywhere
suffering amid the clash of arms. A few words to a man of your wisdom
are sufficient.'</p>

<h2><a name="BOOK_XI_P" id="BOOK_XI_P"></a>BOOK XI.</h2>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>


<p>'<span class="smcap">The</span> necessity for a Preface often arises from some contrariety in an
Author's position which prevents him from writing as he would wish to
write. It is admitted that it is not fair to expect the same degree of
excellence from a busy man which we may reasonably look for in a man
of leisure. But a man in high official position cannot be a man of
leisure. It would be the highest disgrace to him if he were, since
even his so-called privy-chamber<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> resounds with the noise of
clamorous litigants.</p>

<p>'I can well understand that a man of few occupations will object
against me, here that a word has been thrown out with ill-considered
haste, there that a commonplace sentiment has not been dressed up in
sufficiently ornamental language, or there that I have not complied
with the rules of the Ancients by making my persons speak &quot;in
character.&quot; But the busy man, hurried from one cause to another, and
constantly under the necessity of dictating to one man and replying to
another, will not make these objections, because the consciousness of
his own literary perils will make him tender in his judgments. And yet
there is something even in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span> pressure of business which sometimes
promotes briskness of mind, since the art of speaking is one which is
placed very much in our own power<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>.</p>

<p>'If anyone objects that I, placed in the height of the Praetorian
dignity, should have dictated so few decisions of a legal kind, let
him know that this was the result of my associating with myself that
most prudent man <b>
<a href="#err31">Felix</a></b><a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>, whose advice I have followed in every
case. He is a man of absolute purity of character, of surpassing
knowledge of the law, of distinguished accuracy of speech; a young man
with the gravity of age, a sweet pleader, a measured orator; one who
by his graceful discharge of his official duties has earned the
favourable opinion of the public.</p>

<p>'Had it not been for his help, overwhelmed by so great a multitude of
causes, I must either have been found unequal to the burden, or else
perchance have seemed arrogant [in my disregard of previously settled
decisions]. But, what was more important still, relieved by his
labours from this duty, I was able to give such attention to the
higher affairs of the State, that I could not fail to win approbation
even in those arduous duties.</p>

<p>'I have therefore subjoined two books, in which I myself speak in my
capacity as Praefect, to the ten in which I have spoken by the mouth
of the King; for it seemed absurd to me to be silent in my
newly-acquired dignity, who had so often spoken on behalf of others.</p>

<p>'Then, after these twelve books had been brought to their long-desired
end, my friends compelled me to discuss the substance and the powers
of the Soul, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span> I might say something <i>about</i> that faculty
<i>through</i> which I had already said so much<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>.</p>

<p>'Now then, learned men! view these letters with indulgence. If there
be no eloquence in them, attribute it to my many occupations, which
have prevented my reading as much as I would gladly have done. Cicero,
that fountain of eloquence, when he was one day asked to speak,
excused himself on the ground that he had read nothing the day before.
The barn must be constantly refilled if it is not to become empty. All
that is good in our minds is the fruit of study, and soon withers if
it be separated from reading, which is the parent stem. Great
indulgence therefore should be shown to us if we have often had to
write when we were busy, to be read by others when we had no leisure
to read, ourselves. And now enough of excuses, lest too elaborate a
defence should rather injure our cause.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span></p>

is skilled in the niceties of Attic eloquence; she shines in the
majesty of Roman speech; she glories in the wealth of the language of
her fathers. She is equally marvellous in all these, and in each the
orator in his own especial tongue feels himself surpassed by her. A
great safeguard and a great excellence is this in the ruler of so many
nationalities. None needs an interpreter with his accomplished
mistress. No ambassador need wait, or hear his words slowly filtered
through the mind of a go-between. Everyone feels that his own words
are listened to, and receives his answer from her lips in the language
of his forefathers.</p>

<p>'To these accomplishments, as a splendid diadem, is added that
priceless knowledge of Literature, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span> the treasures of ancient
learning are appropriated, and the dignity of the throne is ever
enhanced.</p>

<p>'Yet, while she rejoices in such perfect mastery of language, on
public occasions she is so taciturn that she might be supposed to be
indolent. With a few words she unties the knots of entangled
litigations, she calmly arranges hot disputes, she silently promotes
the public welfare. You do not hear her announce beforehand what will
be her course of action in public; but with marvellous skill she
attains, by feigning, those points which she knows require to be
rapidly gained<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparison to Placidia.</div>

<p>'What case like this can be produced from the annals of revered
Antiquity? Placidia's care for her purple-clad son has often been
celebrated; but by Placidia's lax administration of the Empire its
boundaries were unbecomingly retrenched. She gained for him a wife and
for herself a daughter-in-law<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> by the loss of Illyricum; and thus
the union of Sovereigns was bought by a lamentable division of the
Provinces<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>. The discipline of the soldiers was relaxed by too long
peace; and, in short, Valentinian, under the guardianship of his
mother, lost more than he could have done if he had been a helpless
orphan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Relations with the East.</div>

<p>'But under this Lady, who can count as many Kings as ancestors in her
pedigree, our army by Divine help is a terror to foreign nations.
Being kept in a prudent equipoise it is neither worn away by continual
fighting nor enervated by unbroken peace. In the very beginnings of
the reign, when a new ruler's precarious power is apt to be most
assailed, contrary to the wish of the Eastern Emperor she made the
Danube a Roman stream. Well known is all that the invaders suffered,
of which I therefore omit further mention, that the shame of defeat
may not be too closely associated with the thought of the Emperor, our
ally. Still, what he thought of your part of the Empire is clear from
this, that he conceded to our attack that peace which he has refused
to the abject entreaties of others. Add this fact, that though we have
rarely sought him he has honoured us with so many embassies, and that
thus his unique majesty has bowed down the stately head of the Orient
to exalt the lords of Italy<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition against the Franks.</div>

<p>'The Franks also, overmighty by their victories over so many barbarous
tribes&#8212;by what a great expedition were they harassed! Attacked, they
dreaded a contest with our soldiers; they who had leaped unawares upon
so many nations and forced them into battle. But though that haughty
race declined the offered conflict, they could not prevent the death
of their own King. For Theodoric<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>, he who had so often availed
himself of the name of our glorious King as an occasion for triumph,
now fell vanquished in the struggle with disease&#8212;a stroke of Divine
Providence surely, to prevent us from staining ourselves with the
blood of our kindred, and yet to grant some revenge to the army which
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span> been justly called out to war. Hail! thou Gothic array, happy
above all other happiness, who strikest at the life of a Royal foe,
yet leavest us not the poorer by the life of one of the least of our
soldiers<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">League with the Burgundians.</div>

<p>'The Burgundian too, in order to receive his own again, crouched in
devotion, giving up his whole self that he might receive a trifle. For
he chose to obey with unimpaired territories, rather than to resist
with these cut short; and thus, by laying aside his arms, he most
effectually defended his kingdom, recovering by his prayers what he
had lost by the sword<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>.</p>

<p>'Happy Princess, whose enemies either fall by the hand of God, or else
by your bounty are united with your Empire! Rejoice, Goths and Romans
alike, and hail this marvel, a being who unites the excellences of
both the sexes! As woman she has given birth to your illustrious King,
while with manly fortitude of mind she has maintained the bounds of
your Empire.</p>

<p>'And now, if leaving the realm of war we enter the inner courts of her
moral goodness, a hundred tongues will not suffice to sound forth all
her praises. Her justice is as great as her goodwill, but even greater
is her kindness than her power. You, Senators, know the heavenly
goodness which she has shown to your order, restoring those who had
met with affliction to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span> higher state than that from which they had
fallen<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>, and exalting to honour those who were still uninjured.</p>

<p>'Look at the case of the Patrician Liberius<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>, Praefect of the
Gauls&#8212;a man of charming manners, of distinguished merit, a soldier
with honourable scars&#8212;who even while absent in his Praefecture has
received the <i>fasces</i> and a patrimony from her.</p>

<p>'What can I say of her strength of mind and tenacity of purpose, in
which she excels even philosophers? I speak of this from my own
experience. You know, oh Conscript Fathers, what influences were
arrayed against me<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>. Neither gold nor the prayers of great men
availed: all things were tried, and tried in vain, to prove the
glorious constancy of that wisest Lady.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtues of the Amal Kings.</div>

<p>'And here the rules of rhetoric would require me to compare her with a
long line of Empresses in the past. But if men cannot vie with her
glory, what is the use of adducing female examples? If we look at the
Royal Cohort of her ancestors, we shall see that she, like a pure
mirror, reflects all their excellences. For Amal<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> was conspicuous
for his good fortune, Ostrogotha for his patience, Athal for mildness,
Munitarius [Winithar] for justice, Unimund for beauty, Thorismuth for
chastity, Unalamer [Walamir] for faith, Theudimer for warmth of
heart<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>, and Theodoric, the renowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span> father of Amalasuentha, as ye
have all seen, for patience. Each of these would recognise in her his
own special attribute, but all would acknowledge that in these very
attributes they are excelled by her.</p>

<p>'You will now perhaps expect me to praise our young King, but in
extolling the author of his being, I have abundantly extolled him, her
offspring. You will remember that excellent saying of the eloquent
Symmachus, &quot;I hesitate to praise the beginning of his career because I
am confidently hoping for his advance in virtue<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>.&quot; Come to my

will give us all tranquillity in our time, and will deign to make me
worthy of your love.</p>

<p>'Watch narrowly the acts of the subordinates whom I send among you,
and inform me of anything which they do amiss. I cannot be held
responsible for deeds of which I know nothing. And if they take bribes
they at least cannot justify themselves by saying that they have first
had to pay money for their offices.</p>

<p>'Continue to afford your wonted solace to the widow and orphan; yet
beware that your pity does not lead you to seek to set aside the laws

<p>'We have formed a high opinion of you from long observation of your
career as an Advocate, and feel sure that you will justify that
opinion by your conduct in the office to which we are now calling you.
The Forum has long resounded to your eloquence: now your turn is come
to sit upon the magistrate's bench. Hitherto you have assisted the
officers of the court: now you are yourself called upon to play the
part of a Judge. Even when you are absent from me, you will be deemed
to be sitting by my side; but whatever credit you may earn when
hearing a case by yourself will be reckoned to you alone.</p>

<p>'We therefore ordain that the official staff which waits upon our
orders shall be at your disposal, to carry your decisions into effect,
and to see that none treat them with contempt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span></p>

<p>'If you shall think it necessary to hand over any [insolvent] persons

<p>'I am sure that you will rejoice with me if the needs of the Roman
people can be satisfied by our means, and thus we can testify our
gratitude for the hospitality which we have both received from that
City. To this end have we endured the discomforts of travel, for this
purpose have we racked our brains with anxious thought, that that
people, which tasted such delights of old in the happy days of its
former rulers, may now see its necessities relieved and again enjoy
its former prosperity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>

<p>'Their poverty and hunger we make our own. Therefore, with all speed,
let stores of grain in good condition be at once collected, so that
the bread cooked therefrom may be a delight and not a horror. Let just
weight be given. Flee all thought of unholy profit from this source.
My own soul is wounded if anyone dares to transgress in this matter of
the food-supply of the people. Not favour nor popular applause is my
aim; but to be permitted, by God's help, to accomplish my own heart's
desire.</p>

<p>'I love all my fellow-countrymen, but the Roman citizens deserve more
than ordinary love from me. Theirs is a City adorned with so many
illustrious Senators, blest with such a noble commonalty, a City so
well fitted to celebrate the victories of our glorious rulers. When
the question of my promotion hung in suspense, it was the good wishes

right belongs to you in the official hierarchy<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>. Those who are
above you cheerfully manifest to you a deference which you might be

in their proper place, take without presumption precedence of many of
your superiors.</p>

<p>'This laudable prejudice has assigned to you, from the twelfth
Indiction<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>, the dignity of Cancellarius<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>.</p>

<p>'Guard then the secrets of our Consistory with incorruptible fidelity.
Through your intervention the petitioner for justice has to approach
me. On your acts depends in great measure the opinion which men shall
form of me; for as a house is judged by its front towards the street,
and men by the trimness or shabbiness of their raiment, so are we high
officials judged by the demeanour of our subordinates who represent us
to the crowd. Therefore, if such officials do anything which redounds
to their master's dishonour, they put themselves altogether outside
the pale of his clemency.</p>

<p>'Remember your title, <i>Cancellarius</i>. Ensconced behind the
lattice-work (cancelli) of your compartment, keeping guard behind
those windowed doors, however studiously you may conceal yourself, it
is inevitable that you be the observed of all observers<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>. If you

Antiquity ruled that you should be placed, in order that your actions

<p>'Attend now to this advice which I have given you, and let it not
merely filter through your mind, like water through a pipe, but let it

<div class="sidenote">Duties of the Collectors of Taxes.</div>

<p>'It is an excellent thing that the yearly taxes should be regularly
paid. What confidence does the consciousness of this give to the
taxpayer, who can march boldly through the Forum, feeling that he owes
nothing to anybody and need not fear the face of any official! One can
only enjoy an estate if one has no fear of the process-server making
his appearance upon it.</p>

<p>'Therefore, in the Diocese of your Excellency<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>, we desire you and
your staff at the beginning of this twelfth Indiction<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>, with all
proper gentleness, to impress upon the cultivator of the soil that he
must pay his land-tax<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> and end those long arrears, which were
introduced not for the assistance of the taxpayer, but for the corrupt
profit of the tax-collector. For the officials who in this way
professed to relieve the burdens of the people, really imposed upon
them a heavier and more hateful weight in the shape of douceurs<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>
to themselves.</p>

<p>'Let then this hateful swindling be henceforth banished. Let the
cultivator pay nothing more than his lawful debt to the Treasury, and
let him pay it at the appointed time, thus removing the confusion in
which the slowness of collection has involved our accounts.</p>

<p>'Make up, therefore, the abstracts of accounts<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> at the stated

law and the authority of this present edict; and if you neglect any of
these injunctions, know that you do so at your peril. To quicken your
diligence we have appointed A and B, persons of tried merit in the
past, to supervise the proceedings of yourself and your staff, that
this double check may prevent the possibility of negligence.</p>

<p>'Act then with justice if you wish to receive further promotion. Only
those gains are to be sought for which the cultivator gladly offers
and which the public servant can securely accept. If you take bribes
you will be miserable ever after, through fear of discovery; but if
you act uprightly, you will have in me a willing spectator and
rewarder of your merits. I am most anxious to be your friend; do not
force me against my will to become your enemy.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edict announcing Cassiodorus' principles of
administration.</div>

<p>'The custom of the ancients was for a new ruler to promulgate a new
set of laws to his subjects, but now it is sufficient praise to a
conscientious ruler that he adheres to the legislation of Antiquity.</p>

<p>'Do you all study to perform good actions, and shrink from deeds of
lawlessness and sedition, and you will have nothing to fear from your
Governors. I know that some fear, however irrational, is felt in the
presence of the Judge; but as far as my purpose can avail, with the
help of God and the rulers of the State<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>, I can promise you that
all things shall be done with justice and moderation.</p>

<p>'Venality, that greatest stain upon a Judge's character, will be
unknown in me; for I should think scorn to sell the words that go out
of my lips, like clothes in the market-place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>

<p>'In exercising the right of pre-emption we shall be solely guided by

sell it again<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>.</p>

<p>'Be cheerful and of good courage, therefore, with reference to the new
administration. No soldier or civil servant shall harass you for his
own pleasure. No tax-collector shall load you with burdens of his own
imposition. We are determined to keep not only our own hands clean,
but also those of our officials. Otherwise, vainly does a good Judge
guard himself from receiving money, if he leaves to the many under him
licence to receive it on their own account. But we, both by precept
and example, show that we aim at the public good, not at private and
fraudulent gains.</p>

<p>'We know what prayers you put up for us, how anxiously you watched for
our elevation, and we are determined that you shall not be
disappointed. Our Praetorium, which no base action has ever denied,
shall be open to all. No servile throng shall lord it over you. You
shall come straight to us, making your requests known to us through no
hired interpreter, and none shall leave our presence poorer than he
entered it. With God's help we trust we shall so act as to conform to
the instructions which we have received from our Sovereign<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>; and
we trust that you, by your loyalty, will enable us to be rather the

<div class="sidenote">Exhortation to the Judges to govern in conformity with the
Edict.</div>

<p>'Knowing that past suffering makes men anxious and timid as to the
future, we have put forth an edict [the preceding document] in order
to reassure the minds of the Provincials, and to deliver them from the
torment of ever-present fear.</p>

<p>'Therefore we call upon your Excellency<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> to cause this edict to be
exposed in all the places which are most resorted to. Thus let the
love and devotion of all classes be excited towards our happy
Sovereigns<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>, that as our thoughts towards the people are entirely
thoughts of goodwill, so their dispositions towards the rulers who
govern them in righteousness may be only loyal<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>.</p>

<p>'It now rests with you, by your just government of the Provincials, to
carry our promises into effect.</p>

<p>'Remember that the official staff standing by, is a witness of the
acts of every one of you; and so comport yourselves, that both they
and all others may see that you in your own conduct obey the laws
which you administer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>'Be more anxious to remedy the poverty of the Provincials than to
inflict punishment upon them. So act that when you are giving an
account of your stewardship your year of office may be felt to have
been all too short<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>. If you have acted justly, and earned the
goodwill of your Provincials, you will have no need of gifts to stave
off accusations.</p>

<p>'We do not appoint any spies upon your actions, and we pray you so to
act that this most humiliating expedient may not be necessary.</p>

<p>'If you meet with any who pertinaciously set themselves up against the
authority of your <i>fasces</i>, send us at once a messenger with your
report; or, if you cannot spare such an one, send the report alone, as
you have authority to use the public postal-service<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>. Thus all
excuse for remissness on your part is taken away, since you can either
wield your power or explain to us the hindrances which beset you.'</p>

bodies seem like leaky casks, from which all strength must soon
dribble away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The milk-cure, a remedy for consumption.</div>

<p>'As an antidote to this cruel malady Heaven has given us the Mons
Lactarius, where the salubrious air working together with the fatness
of the soil has produced a herbage of extraordinary sweetness. The
cows which are fed on this herbage give a milk which seems to be the
only remedy for consumptive patients who have been quite given over by
their physicians. As sleep refreshes the weary limbs of toil, so does
this milk fill up the wasted limbs and restore the vanished strength.
Strange is it to see the herds feeding on this abundant pasture. They
look as if it did not profit them at all. Thin and scraggy, as they
wander through the thickets they look like the patients who seek their
aid; yet their milk is so thick that it sticks to the milker's
fingers.</p>

<p>'Do you therefore supply the invalid when he arrives, with the
appointed rations and pecuniary allowance, that he may be suitably
maintained in that place while he is recreating his exhausted energies
with the food of infancy.</p>

<p>'And, oh! all ye who are suffering under the like grievous malady,
lift up your hearts. There is hope for you. By no bitter antidote, but
by a delicious draught, you shall imbibe life&#8212;life, in itself the

<div class="sidenote">Prices at Ravenna.</div>

<p>'The price at which provisions are sold ought to follow, in a
reasonable way, the circumstances of the times, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span> there may be
neither cheapness in a dear season, nor dearness in a cheap one, and
that the grumblings of both buyers and sellers may be avoided, by
fairness being observed towards both.</p>

<p>'Therefore, after careful consideration, we have fixed in the
subjoined schedule the prices of the various articles of produce,
which prices are to remain free from all ambiguity.</p>

<p>'If any vendor does not observe the prices named in the present edict,
he will be liable to a fine of six solidi (&#163;3 12s.) for each violation
of the law, and may be visited by corporal punishment<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>.'</p>

<p>[The schedule mentioned in this letter is unfortunately not preserved.
Few documents that Cassiodorus could have handed down to posterity
would have been more valuable. If we could have compared it with the
celebrated Edict of Stratonicea (cir. <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 301), we should have seen
what changes had been wrought in the value of the precious metals and
the distribution of wealth during the two centuries of disturbance and
barbaric invasion which had elapsed since the reign of Diocletian.
But, unfortunately, Cassiodorus believed that his rhetoric and his
natural history would be more interesting to us than these vulgar
facts.]</p>

<p>'If prices need to be fixed for the leisurely inhabitant of a town,
much more for the traveller, whose journey may otherwise become a
burden instead of a pleasure. Let strangers therefore find that they
are entertained by you at fixed prices. To fawn upon them with feigned
politeness and then terrify them with enormous charges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span> is the act of
a highway robber. Do you not know how much better moderate prices

accommodation-houses<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> if they found that you treated them fairly.</p>

charged there; and then whosoever dares to ask higher prices will have
to pay a fine of six solidi (&#163;3 12s.) and will be afflicted by the
laceration of his body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Supplications of the Senate to Justinian.</div>

<p>'It seems a right and proper thing that we should address our prayers
for the safety of the Roman Republic to a dutiful Sovereign<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>, who
can only desire what will benefit our freedom. We therefore beseech
you, most clement Emperor, and from the bosom of the Curia we stretch
forth our two hands to you in prayer, that you will grant a most
enduring peace to our King. Spurn not us, who ever seemed certain of
your love. It is in truth the Roman name that you are commending, if
you grant gracious terms to our lords. May your league with them
assure the peace of Italy; and if our prayers be not sufficient to
accomplish this thing, imagine that you hear our country break forth
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span> these words of supplication: &quot;If ever I was acceptable to thee,
love, oh most dutiful Sovereign, love my defenders! They who rule me
ought to be in harmony with thee, lest otherwise they begin to do such
deeds towards me as thou least of all men wouldest desire. Be not to
me a cause of death, thou who hast ever ministered unto me the joys of
life. Lo, while at peace with thee I have doubled the number of my
children, I have been decked with the glory of my citizens. If thou
sufferest me to be wounded, where is thy dutiful name of Son? What
couldest even thou do more for me [than these rulers], seeing that my
religion and thine thus flourish under their rule?</p>

<p>'&quot;My Senate grows in honour and is incessantly increasing in wealth.
Do not dissipate in quarrels what thou oughtest rather to defend with
the sword. I have had many Kings; but none so trained in letters as
this one. I have had foreseeing statesmen, but none so powerful in
learning and religion. I love the Amal, bred up as he has been at my
knees, a strong man, one who has been formed by my conversation, dear
to the Romans by his prudence, venerable to the nations by his valour.
Join rather thy prayers to his; share with him thy counsels: so that
any prosperity which I may earn may redound to thy glory. Do not woo
me in the only fashion in which I may not be won. Thine am I already
in love, if thou sendest none of thy soldiers to lacerate my limbs.
For if Africa has deserved through thee to recover freedom, it were
hard that I should from the same hand lose that freedom which I have
ever possessed. Control the emotions of anger, oh illustrious
conqueror! The claims urged upon thee by the general voice of the
people ought to outweigh the offence which the ingratitude of any
private individual may have occasioned to thy heart.&quot;</p>

<p>'Thus Rome speaks while, through her Senators, she makes supplications
to you. And if that be not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span> enough, let the sacred petition of the
blessed Apostles Peter and Paul be also taken into your account. For
surely they, who are proved to have so often defended the peace of
Rome from her enemies, deserve that your Sovereignty should yield
everything to their merits. The venerable man, our most pious King's
ambassador to your Clemency, will further set forth our prayers.'</p>

<p>[It is not easy to fix the exact occasion on which this petition was
likely to be sent from the Senate to the Emperor. The allusion to the
conquest of Africa shows that it was after the Vandal War, which ended
in March, 534. On the other hand, the language put into the mouth of
the Senate implies that the Imperial troops had not yet landed in
Italy or Sicily, and the petition is therefore of an earlier date than
the summer of 535. During the whole of these fourteen months the
relations between Empire and Kingdom were more or less strained, the
causes of complaint on the part of Constantinople beginning with the
occupation of Lilybaeum and ending with the murder of Amalasuentha. I
fear that the nattering portrait drawn of 'the Amal' can apply to no
one but Theodahad, the terms used being hopelessly inapplicable to a
boy like Athalaric. Who then are 'our lords' ('nostri Domini'), in
whose name peace is besought. The best that we can hope, for the sake
of the reputation of Cassiodorus, is that they are Amalasuentha and
Theodahad, the letter being written between October 2, 534 (when
Athalaric died), and April 30, 535 (when Amalasuentha was imprisoned).
Upon the whole this seems the most probable conclusion. If written
after Amalasuentha's death, in the few months or weeks which
intervened between that event and the landing of Belisarius in Sicily,
the language employed reflects deep discredit on the writer. In that
case, 'nostri Domini' must mean Theodahad and Gudelina.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

beautifully situated, do not become a solitude for want of
inhabitants.</p>

<p>'Como, with its precipitous mountains and its vast expanse of lake,
seems placed there for the defence of the Province of Liguria; and
yet, again, it is so beautiful that one would think it was created for
pleasure only. To the south lies a fertile plain with easy roads for
the transport of provisions; on the north a lake sixty miles long,
abounding in fish, soothing the mind with delicious recreation.</p>

<p>'Rightly is it called <i>Como</i>, because it is adorned (compta) with such
gifts. The lake lies in a shell-like valley, with white margins. Above
rises a diadem of lofty mountains, their slopes studded with bright
villas<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>, a girdle of olives below, vineyards above, while a crest
of thick chestnut-woods adorns the very summit of the hills. Streams
of snowy clearness dash from the hill-sides into the lake. On the
eastern side these unite to form the river Addua, so called because it
contains the <i>added</i> volume of two streams. It plunges into the lake
with such force that it keeps its own colour<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> (dark among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>

phenomenon often seen with rivers flowing into the ocean, but surely
marvellous with one flowing into an inland lake. And so swift is its
course as it moves through the alien waves, that you might fancy it a
river flowing over the solid plains.</p>

<p>'It was well ordered by Antiquity that the servants of the Public
should receive a due reward for their labours; and who of all these
are more deserving than the officers of the Praetorian Praefect
(Praetoriani). Theirs is the difficult task of waiting on the
necessities of the army. They must demand accounts, often minute and
intricate, from great officers whom they dare not offend. They must
collect the stores of food for the Roman people from the Provincials

avaricious and impudent charges for the paper which bore it<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>.</p>

fluently or pleasantly on the rough bark of trees, though it is from
that practice that we call a book <i>Liber</i>? While the scribe was
laboriously cutting his letters on the sordid material, his very
thought grew cold: a rude contrivance assuredly, and only fit for the
beginnings of the world.</p>

<p>'Then was paper discovered, and therewith was eloquence made possible.
Paper, so smooth and so continuous, the snowy entrails of a green
herb; paper which can be spread out to such a vast extent, and yet be
folded up into such a little space; paper, on whose white expanse the
black characters look beautiful; paper which keeps the sweet harvest

Cancellarius of Lucania and Bruttii</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Payment by Province of Bruttii of commuted cattle-tax.</div>

<p>'The vast numbers of the Roman people in old time are evidenced by the
extensive Provinces from which their food supply was drawn, as well as
by the wide circuit of their walls, the massive structure of their
amphitheatre, the marvellous bigness of their public baths, and the
enormous multitude of mills, which could only have been made for use,
not for ornament.</p>

<p>'It was to feed this population, that mountainous Lucania paid her
tribute of swine, that fertile Bruttii furnished her droves of oxen.
It was a glorious privilege for them thus to feed the Roman people:
yet the length of roads over which the animals had to be driven made
the tribute unnecessarily burdensome, since every mile reduced their
weight, and the herdsman could not possibly obtain credit at the
journey's end for the same number of pounds of flesh which he
possessed at its beginning. For this reason the tribute was commuted
into a money payment, one which no journeyings can diminish and no
toil can wound. The Provinces should understand and respond to this
favourable change, and not show themselves more slack than their
ancestors were, under far more burdensome conditions. Your Diligence
has now collected both these taxes<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> at the appointed periods; and

magistrates with praiseworthy diligence, might not seem negligent
under my rule. These Provinces, which I, my grandfather, and my
great-grandfather have benefited as private persons, I have
endeavoured to help yet more earnestly while I bore the majesty of the
<i>fasces</i>, that they who have rejoiced in my exaltation might see that
I still retained my love for our common country. Let them pay the tax
then, not from fear but from love. I have prevailed on the royal
generosity to limit its amount; for whereas it used to be 1,200 solidi

<p>'Therefore, O Lictor, thou who art allowed to do with impunity the
very thing for which other men are punished, put up thy axe; let it be
henceforth bright, not bloody. Let the chains which have been so often
wet with tears now grow rusty. The prison&#8212;that house of Pluto, in
which men suffer a living death, from its foul odours, from the sound
of groaning which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span> assails their ears, from the long fastings which
destroy their taste, from the heavy weights which weary their hands,
from the endless darkness which makes their eyes grow dim&#8212;let the
prison now be filled with emptiness. Never is it so popular as when it
is seen to be deserted.</p>

<p>'And you, its denizens, who are thus in a manner transplanted to
Heaven from Hell, avoid the evil courses which made you acquainted
with its horrors. Even animals shun the things which they have once
found harmful. Cattle which have once fallen into a pit seek not again
the same road. The bird once snared shuns bird-lime. The pike buries
himself in deep sand, that he may escape the drag-net, and when it has
scraped his back leaps nimbly into the waves and expresses by his
gambols his joy for his deliverance. When the wrasse<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> finds that
he is caught in an osier trap, he moves himself slowly backwards till
he can leave his tail protruding, that one of his fellows, perceiving
his capture, may pull him out from his prison.</p>

<p>'So too the Sauri (?), a clever race of fish, named from their speed,
when they have swum into a net, tie themselves together into a sort of
rope; and then, tugging backwards with all their might, seek to
liberate their fellow-prisoners.</p>

<p>'Many facts of the same kind would be discovered on enquiry. But my
discourse must return to thee, O Gaoler. Thou wilt be miserable in the
general joy, because thou art wont to derive thy gladness from the
affliction of many. But as some consolation for thy groans, we leave
to thee those prisoners whom the Law, for very pity's sake, cannot set
free&#8212;the men found guilty of outrageous crimes, whose liberation
would make barbarous deeds frequent. Over these thou mayest still
exert thy power.'</p>

<p>'What avails the reputation of being a rich man? It confers no glory.
But to be known as a just man wins the praise of all. Nothing mean or
avaricious is becoming in a Judge. All his faults are made more
conspicuous by his elevation. Better were it to be absolutely unknown,
than to be marked out for the scorn of all men. Let us keep our own

<p>'There must be fear of the magistrate in the heart of the citizen,

Do not study popularity. Attend only to those cases which are

<div class="sidenote">Praise of Acinaticium, a red wine of Verona.</div>

<p>'A well furnished royal table is a credit to the State. A private
person may eat only the produce of his own district; but it is the
glory of a King to collect at his table the delicacies of all lands.
Let the Danube send us her carp, let the <i>anchorago</i> (?) come from the
Rhine, let the labour of Sicily furnish the <i>exormiston</i><a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>, let the

well-flavoured dishes be gathered from all coasts. It becomes a King
so to regale himself that he may seem to foreign ambassadors to
possess almost everything.</p>

<p>'And therefore, not to neglect home-produce also, as our fertile Italy
is especially rich in wines, we must have these also provided for the
King's table. Now the report of the Count of the Patrimony informs us
that the stock of <i>Acinaticium</i><a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> has fallen very low in the royal
cellars. We therefore order you to visit the cultivators of Verona,
and offer them a sufficient price for this product of theirs, which
they ought to offer without price to their Sovereign.</p>

<p>'It is in truth a noble wine and one that Italy may be proud of.
Inglorious Greece may doctor her wines with foreign admixtures, or
disguise them with perfumes. There is no need of any such process with
this liquor. It is purple, as becomes the wine of kings. Sweet and
strong<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>, it grows more dense in tasting it, so that you might

<p>'I have a mind to describe the singular mode of manufacturing this
wine. The grape cluster, gathered in autumn, is hung up under the roof
of the house to dry till December. Thus exuding its insipid humours it
becomes much sweeter. Then in December, when everything else is bound
by the frost of winter, the chilly blood of these grapes is allowed to
flow forth. It is not insultingly trodden down by the feet, nor is any

<div class="sidenote">Measures for relief of Lucania and Bruttii.</div>

<p>'The ruler's anxiety for the common good of all over whom he is
placed, may allowably show itself in an especial manner towards the
dwellers in his own home, and that pre-eminently at a time when they
need his succour from peril.</p>

<p>'The numerous army which was destined for the defence of the Republic
is said to have laid waste the cultivated parts of Lucania and
Bruttii, and to have diminished the abundance of those regions by its
love of rapine.</p>

<p>'Now since they must take and you must give, and since the cultivator
must not be robbed nor the army starved, know that the prices of
provisions are fixed by the order of the Lord of the State at a much
lower figure than you have been wont to sell at<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>.</p>

<p>'Be not therefore anxious. You have escaped the hands of the
tax-collector. The present instrument takes away from you the
liability to tribute. In order that your knowledge may be made more
complete, we have thought it better that the amounts of the provisions
for which you are held responsible should be expressed in the
below-written letters<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>, that no one may sell you a benefit which
you know to be conferred by the public generosity.</p>

While the Gothic army is fighting, let the Roman peasant enjoy in
quiet the peace for which he sighs. According to the King's command,
admonish the several tenants on the farms, and the better sort of

danger to public tranquillity be greater than any service they can
render in the wars<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>. Let them lay hands to the iron, but only to
cultivate their fields; let them grasp the pointed steel, but only to
goad their oxen.</p>

<p>'Let the Judges be active: let the tribunals echo with their
denunciations of crime. Let the robber, the adulterer, the forger, the
thief, find that the arm of the State is still strong to punish their
crimes. True freedom rejoices when these men are made sad. Here, in
this civil battle, is full scope for your energies: attend to this,
and enjoy the thought that others are fighting the battle with the
foreign foe for you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></p>

<p>'Exercise great care in calculating the rations of the soldiers, that
no trickery may succeed in defrauding the soldier of his due.</p>

<p>'The officers of the army are by the rulers of the State placed under
my authority, and you are therefore to admonish them if they go wrong,
while redressing all their real grievances. They, in their turn, must
uphold discipline, which is the most powerful weapon of an army. Rise
to the dignity of the occasion, and show that you are able to govern a
Province in a disturbed condition of public affairs, since anyone can
govern it while all things are quiet.</p>

<p>'The royal household is specially ordered to pay the same obedience to
this rescript as all the rest of the Province; and as for my own

<div class="sidenote">African claims to succeed to estate of an intestate
countryman.</div>

<p>[To make this letter intelligible we must presuppose a custom,
certainly a very extraordinary one, by which on the death of an
African without heirs, any other African in Italy was allowed to claim
the inheritance. By 'African,' no doubt, we must understand one of the
indigenous inhabitants of Africa, perhaps a man of Negro race. The
custom certainly cannot have applied to African Provincials of Roman
descent. It was perhaps based on some old tribal notions of joint
possession and mutual inheritance.]</p>

<p>'It is a work of wondrous kindness to oblige a foreign race with
public benefits, and not only to invite blood relations to enjoy the
advantages of property, but to permit even strangers to share them.
This kind of heirship is independent of the ties of kindred,
independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span> of succession from parents, and requires nothing else
save only power to utter the speech of the fatherland.</p>

<p>'This is the privilege which, as the African asserts, was of old
bestowed on his race. By virtue thereof they lawfully demand the
inheritance of others, and thus obtain a right which the Roman in a
similar case could never claim. Nor have they this benefit in their
own land; but here they are for this purpose looked upon as all
related to one another.</p>

<p>'The whole nation, in what relates to the advantages of succession, is
regarded as one family.</p>

<p>'Your Experience is therefore to submit the subject of this man's
petition to a diligent examination, and if it shall turn out, as he
alleges, that the deceased has left no sons nor other persons who
might reasonably claim to succeed him, your official staff is to
induct him into the aforesaid property according to the established
usage.</p>

<p>'He will thus cease to be a foreigner, and will acquire the status of
a native possessor, and therewith the usual liability to pay tribute.
He is inferior to other owners only in this one point, that he lacks
the power of alienating his property. Let him who has derived so much
benefit from our commiseration now relieve others. Fortunate and
enviable has turned out his captivity<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>, which enables him at one

<p>'The <i>cheese</i>, which retains in its pores the milk which has been

<div class="sidenote">Praises of the author's birthplace, Scyllacium.</div>

<p>'Scyllacium, the first city of Bruttii, which Ulysses the destroyer of
Troy is believed to have founded, is said to be unreasonably vexed by
the exorbitant demands of purveyors<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>. These injuries grieve us all
the more on account of our patriotic love for the place.</p>

<p>'The city of Scyllacium, which is so placed as to look down upon the
Hadriatic Gulf, hangs upon the hills like a cluster of grapes: not
that it may pride itself upon their difficult ascent, but that it may
voluptuously gaze on verdant plains and the blue back of the sea. The
city beholds the rising sun from its very cradle, when the day that is
about to be born sends forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span> no heralding Aurora; but as soon as it
begins to rise, the quivering brightness displays its torch. It
beholds Phoebus in his joy; it is bathed in the brightness of that
luminary, so that it might be thought to be itself the native land of
the sun, the claims of Rhodes to that honour being outdone.</p>

<p>'It enjoys a translucent air, but withal so temperate that its winters
are sunny, and its summers cool; and life passes there without sorrow,
since hostile seasons are feared by none. Hence, too, man himself is
here freer of soul than elsewhere, for this temperateness of the
climate prevails in all things.</p>

<p>'In sooth, a hot fatherland makes its children sharp and fickle, a
cold one slow and sly; it is only a temperate climate which composes
the characters of men by its own moderation. Hence was it that the
ancients pronounced Athens to be the seat of sages, because, enriched
with an air of the greatest purity, it prepared with glad liberality
the lucid intellects of its sons for the contemplative part of life.
Assuredly for the body to imbibe muddy waters is a different thing
from sucking in the transparency of a sweet fountain. Even so the
vigour of the mind is repressed when it is clogged by a heavy
atmosphere. Nature herself hath made us subject to these influences.
Clouds make us feel sad; and again a bright sky fills us with joy,
because the heavenly substance of the soul delights in everything that
is unstained and pure.</p>

<p>'Scyllacium has also an abundant share of the delicacies of the sea,
possessing near it those gates of Neptune which we ourselves
constructed. At the foot of the Moscian Mount we hollowed out the
bowels of the rock, and tastefully<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> introduced therein the eddying
waves of Nereus. Here a troop of fishes, sporting in free captivity,
refreshes all minds with delight, and charms all eyes with admiration.
They run greedily to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span> the hand of man, and before they become his food
seek dainties from him. Man feeds his own dainty morsels, and while he
has that which can bring them into his power, it often happens that
being already replete he lets them all go again.</p>

<p>'The spectacle moreover of men engaged in honourable labour is not
denied to those who are sitting tranquilly in the city. Plenteous
vineyards are beheld in abundance. The fruitful toil of the
threshing-floor is seen. The face of the green olive is disclosed. No
one need sigh for the pleasures of the country, when it is given him
to see them all from the town.</p>

<p>'And inasmuch as it has now no walls, you believe Scyllacium to be a
rural city, though you might judge it to be an urban villa; and thus
placed between the two worlds of town and country, it is lavishly
praised by both.</p>

<p>'This place wayfarers desire frequently to visit, and as they object
to the toil of walking, the citizens, called upon to provide them with
post-horses, and rations for their servants, have to pay heavily in
purse for the pleasantness of their city. Therefore to prevent this,
for the future we decide that all charges for providing post-horses
and rations shall be debited to the public account. We cut up, root
and branch, the system of paying <i>Pulveratica</i><a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> to the Judge; and
we decide, according to ancient custom, that rations for three days
only shall be given on their arrival to the great Dignitaries of the
State, and that any more prolonged delay in their locomotion be
provided for by themselves.</p>

<p>'To relieve your city of its heaviest burdens will be, according to
our injunctions, an act of judicial impartiality, not of laxity. Live,
by God's help, a mirror of the justice of the age, delighting in the
security of all. Some people call the Isles of the Atlantic
'Fortunate:' I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span> would rather give that name to the place where you do
now dwell.'</p>

the waves of Tiber with a bridge [of boats]. The boat, thus used, is
no longer moved by slowly hauled ropes, as it is wont to be. Fixed
itself, it affords a means of transit to others. The joining of its
planks gives the desired appearance of solidity; all the terror of the

passing over it unharmed only wishes that the bridge were longer.</p>

coupled with the directions in the preceding letter for the repair of

<div class="sidenote">Sacred vessels mortgaged by Pope Agapetus to be restored to
the stewards of the Papal See.</div>

<p>'You will remember, most faithful Sirs, that when the holy Agapetus,
Pope of the City of Rome, was sent as ambassador to the Sovereign of
the East<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>, he received so many pounds of gold from you for the

some of the Church plate as security<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>. The provident ruler thus
lent him money in his necessity, and now, far more gloriously, returns
as a free gift those pledges which the Pope might well have thanked
him for taking.</p>

<p>'Therefore, in obedience to these instructions of ours, and fortified
by the Royal order, do you return without any delay to the
stewards<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> of the holy Apostle Peter the vessels of the saints
together with the written obligation, that these things may be felt to
be profitably restored and speedily granted, that the longed-for means
of performing their world-famous ministrations may be replaced in the
hands of the Levites. Let that be given back which was their own,
since that is justly received back by way of largesse which the Priest
had legally mortgaged.</p>

<p>'Herein is the great example of King Alaric surpassed. He, when
glutted with the spoil of Rome, having received the vessels of the
Apostle Peter from his men, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span> heard the story of their seizure,
ordered them to be carried back across the sacred threshold, that so
the remembrance of the cupidity of their capture might be effaced by
the generosity of their restoration.</p>

<p>'But our King, with religious purpose, has restored the vessels which
had become his own by the law of mortgage. In recompense for such
deeds frequent prayer ought to ascend, and Heaven will surely gladly
grant the required return for such good actions<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>.'</p>

<p>[There are in this letter several extremely obscure sentences as to
the generosity of Theodahad. As the Papal journey was undertaken by
Theodahad's orders, it was a piece of meanness, quite in keeping with
that King's character, to treat the advance of money for the journey
as a loan, and to insist on a bond and the deposit of the Church plate
as a security for repayment. Cassiodorus evidently feels this; and
very probably the restoration of the vessels and the quittance of the
debt had been insisted on by him. But the more he despises his
master's shabbiness, the more he struggles through a maze of almost
nonsensical sentences, to prove that he has committed some very
glorious action in lending the money and then forgiving the debt.]</p>

<p>'Banish, therefore, all thoughts of venality from your mind. The worst

dishonest litigant, who bribes the Scribes to make away with evidence

only, do not compose ancient proceedings<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>. Let the copy correspond

<p>[This letter was written Sept. 1, 537, probably in consequence of the
scarcity which the operations of Belisarius were already causing at
Ravenna. Apparently the whole taxes levied from a Province at an
Indiction were divided into two heads: so much for the central
authority, and so much for the Province. Cassiodorus in this and the
following letter says in effect: 'All the State's share of the taxes
we will take not in money, but in your staple products, corn, wine,
and oil. The rest goes as usual to the Province; but owing to the
scarcity at Ravenna we shall be glad to buy all that can be spared
either by the authorities of the Province or by individuals, whether
farmers or merchants.']</p>

<p>'The true way to prevent the requirements of the public revenue from
becoming oppressive, is to order each Province to supply those
products in which it is naturally most fertile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Requisition from Province of Istria.</div>

<p>'Now I have learned by conversation with travellers that the Province
of Istria is this year especially blessed in three of its crops&#8212;wine,
oil, and corn. Therefore let her give of these products the equivalent
of ... solidi, which are due from you in payment of tribute for this
first Indiction<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>: while the remainder we leave to that loyal
Province for her own regular expenses. But since we require a larger
quantity of the above-mentioned products, we send ... solidi from our
state chest for the purchase of them, that these necessaries may be
collected for us with as little delay as possible. Often when you are
desirous to sell you cannot find a purchaser, and suffer loss
accordingly. How much better is it to obey the requirements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span> your

of the soil, rather than to wait on the caprices of a buyer!</p>

<p>'We will ourselves out of our love of justice state a fact of which
you might otherwise remind us, that we can afford to be liberal in
price because we are not burdened by the payment of freights [on
account of your nearness to the seat of government]. For what Campania
is to Rome, Istria is to Ravenna&#8212;a fruitful Province abounding in
corn, wine, and oil; so to speak, the cupboard of the capital. I might
carry the comparison further, and say that Istria can show her own
Baiae in the lagunes with which her shores are indented<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>, her own

appreciated its delights<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>. The beautiful chain of islands with
which it is begirt, shelter the sailor from danger and enrich the
cultivator. The residence of the Court in this district delights the
nobles and enriches the lower orders; and it may be said that all its
products find their way to the Royal city. Now let the loyal Province,
which has often tendered her services when they were less required,
send forward her stores freely.</p>

care of man into a firm foundation<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>. For by a twisted and knotted
osier-work the earth there collected is turned into a solid mass, and
you oppose without fear to the waves of the sea so fragile a bulwark,
since forsooth the mass of waters is unable to sweep away the shallow
shore, the deficiency in depth depriving the waves of the necessary
power.</p>

<p>'The inhabitants have one notion of plenty, that of gorging themselves
with fish. Poverty therefore may associate itself with wealth on equal
terms. One kind of food refreshes all; the same sort of dwelling
shelters all; no one can envy his neighbour's home; and living in this
moderate style they escape that vice [of envy] to which all the rest
of the world is liable.</p>

<p>'Your whole attention is concentrated on your salt-works. Instead of
driving the plough or wielding the sickle, you roll your cylinders.
Thence arises your whole crop, when you find in them that product
which you have not manufactured<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>. There it may be said is your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
subsistence-money coined<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>. Of this art of yours every wave is a
bondservant. In the quest for gold a man may be lukewarm: but salt
every one desires to find; and deservedly so, since to it every kind
of meat owes its savour.</p>

<p>'Therefore let your ships, which you have tethered, like so many
beasts of burden, to your walls, be repaired with diligent care: so
that when the most experienced Laurentius attempts to bring you his
instructions, you may hasten forth to greet him. Do not by any
hindrance on your part delay the necessary purchases which he has to
make; since you, on account of the character of your winds, are able
to choose the shortest sea-track<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>.'</p>

<p>[This letter appears to have been written in the early autumn of 538,
about a year after the three last letters, and also after Letters
<a href="#xii27">27</a>
and <a href="#xii28">28</a>, which precede it in order of date, though they follow it in
this collection. For an account of the terrible famine in Italy, the
beginning of which is here described, see Procopius, De Bello Gotthico
ii. 20.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Famine in Italy.</div>

<p>'Since the world is not governed by chance, but by a Divine Ruler who
does not change His purposes at random, men are alarmed, and naturally
alarmed, at the extraordinary signs in the heavens, and ask with
anxious hearts what events these may portend. The Sun, first of stars,
seems to have lost his wonted light, and appears of a bluish colour.
We marvel to see no shadows of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span> bodies at noon, to feel the mighty
vigour of his heat wasted into feebleness, and the phenomena which
accompany a transitory eclipse prolonged through a whole year.</p>

<p>'The Moon too, even when her orb is full, is empty of her natural
splendour. Strange has been the course of the year thus far. We have
had a winter without storms, a spring without mildness, and a summer
without heat. Whence can we look for harvest, since the months which
should have been maturing the corn have been chilled by Boreas? How
can the blade open if rain, the mother of all fertility, is denied to
it? These two influences, prolonged frost and unseasonable drought,
must be adverse to all things that grow. The seasons seem to be all
jumbled up together, and the fruits, which were wont to be formed by
gentle showers, cannot be looked for from the parched earth. But as
last year was one that boasted of an exceptionally abundant harvest,
you are to collect all of its fruits that you can, and store them up
for the coming months of scarcity, for which it is well able to
provide. And that you may not be too much distressed by the signs in
the heavens of which I have spoken, return to the consideration of
Nature, and apprehend the reason of that which makes the vulgar gape
with wonder.</p>

<p>'The middle air is thickened by the rigour of snow and rarefied by the
beams of the Sun. This is the great Inane, roaming between the heavens
and the earth. When it happens to be pure and lighted up by the rays
of the sun it opens out its true aspect<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>; but when alien elements
are blended with it, it is stretched like a hide across the sky, and
suffers neither the true colours of the heavenly bodies to appear nor
their proper warmth to penetrate. This often happens in cloudy weather
for a time; it is only its extraordinary prolongation which has
produced these disastrous effects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span> causing the reaper to fear a new
frost in harvest, making the apples to harden when they should grow
ripe, souring the old age of the grape-cluster.</p>

<p>'All this, however, though it would be wrong to construe it as an omen
of Divine wrath, cannot but have an injurious effect on the fruits of
the earth. Let it be your care to see that the scarcity of this one
year does not bring ruin on us all. Even thus was it ordained by the
first occupant of our present dignity<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>, that the preceding plenty
should avail to mitigate the present penury.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remission of taxes for Province of Venetia in consequence
of the famine.</div>

<p>'We are glad when we can reconcile the claims of the public service
with the suggestions of pity. The Venerable Augustin, a man
illustrious by his life and name, has brought under our notice the
lamentable petition of the Venetians, to the effect that there have
been in their Province no crops of wine, wheat, or millet, and that
they must be ruined unless the Royal pity succours them.</p>

<p>'In these circumstances it would be cruel to exact the customary
supplies from them, and we therefore remit the contributions of wine
and wheat for the use of the army which we had ordered from the cities
of Concordia, Aquileia, and Forojulii<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>, exacting only the meat, as

<p>'We shall send from hence a sufficient supply of wheat when the time
comes; and as we are told that there is a plentiful crop of wine in
Istria, you can buy there the wine that would have been furnished by
the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span> cities. Be sure that you ask for no fee in this matter.
This remission of taxes is absolutely gratuitous on our part.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relief of famine-stricken citizens of Ticinum and Dertona.</div>

<p>'It is most fitting that good and holy men should be made the stewards
of the Royal bounty. We therefore request your Holiness, in accordance
with the King's commands, to open the granaries at Ticinum<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>, and
Dertona<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>, and sell millet thereat to the starving people at the
rate of 20 modii per solidum<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>. We are anxious that you should do
this, lest the work should fall into venal hands which would sell the
King's bounty to those who are able to provide for themselves. It is
the poor, not the rich, that we wish to help: we would pour our bounty
into empty vessels. Let not then your Holiness think this work of
compassion, unworthy of your sacred office. In order to assist you we
have sent A and B, who will simply obey the orders of your Holiness,
doing nothing of their own motion.</p>

<p>'Send us an account of the solidi received in payment for the said
millet, that they may be stored up with our Treasurer<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>, in order
to replace the before-mentioned grain, and thus provide a reserve for
future times of scarcity; like a garment taken to pieces that it may
be made up again as good as new.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span></p>
<p>[It is not very easy to assign a date to this letter. The mention of
the famine would incline us to assign it to 538, as that seems to have
been the year when the full force of the famine was felt in Italy (see
Procopius, De Bello Gotthico ii. 20, where 538 and 539 seem to be
marked as the two great famine years). But very early in 538 the
Bishop of Milan, the same Datius to whom this letter is addressed,
visited Rome to entreat Belisarius to send a small garrison to occupy
Milan, which had already revolted, or was on the verge of revolting,
from the Gothic King. As soon as the siege of Rome was raised
Belisarius complied with this request, and sent 1,000 men, under
Mundilas, to escort Datius back to Milan. This expedition set forth
probably in April 538, and as soon as it arrived at Milan that city
openly proclaimed its defection from Witigis and its allegiance to the
Emperor. It was soon besieged by Uraias, nephew of Witigis, by whom in
the following year (539) it was taken. The city, we are informed, was
rased to the ground, and Bishop Datius escaped to Constantinople.
Evidently we have here a continuous chain of events, which makes it
impossible for us to date this letter in 538 or any subsequent year.</p>

<p>We ought probably therefore to assign it to the autumn of 537, and to
look upon it as an attempt (unsuccessful, as it proved) to retain
Datius and the citizens of Milan on the side of the Goths. We know
from the <a href="#xii22">Twenty-second Letter</a> of this book that signs of scarcity had
already shown themselves in Italy by the 1st September, 537; and in an
interesting passage of the 'Historia Miscella' (Book xvi.), famine in
Liguria, the year 537, and the name of Datius are all combined.
'Praeter belli instantiam angebatur insuper Roma famis penuri&#226;: tanta
siquidem per universum mundum eo anno [the year of the siege of Rome],
<i>maxime apud Liguriam</i> fames excreverat, ut <i>sicut vir sanctissimus
Datius Me</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span><i>diolanensis antistes retulit</i>, pleraeque matres infelicium

<h3><a name="xii28">28.</a> <span class="smcap">An Edict [addressed to the Ligurians]</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Relief of inhabitants of Liguria.</div>

<p>'Divine Providence uses adversity as a means of testing our
characters. Famine has afflicted the Provinces, but the result of it
has been that they have proved more fully than before the bounty of
their King. Rejoice herein, oh ye Ligurians! For when, as you will
remember, on a previous occasion the savage temper of your neighbours
was aroused, and Aemilia and your Liguria were shaken by an incursion
of the Burgundians, who waged a sneaking campaign by reason of their
nearness to your territory, suddenly the renown of the insulted
Empire<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> arose like the sun in his strength. The enemy mourned the
ruin which was caused by his own presumption, when he learned that
that man was Ruler of the Gothic race whose rare valour he had
experienced when he was still a private soldier<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>. How often did
the Burgundian wish that he had never left his own frontiers to be
compelled to fight with such an adversary as our Sovereign; for though
he found with relief that he escaped his actual presence in the field,
none the less did his rashness bring him in contact with the good
fortune of his arms. For when with redoubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span> fortitude<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> the Goths
turned to the prosecution of the war, with such successfully combined
operations did they strike the bands of the rebels, that you would
have thought those were all armed men, these were all
defenceless<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>. Such was the just judgment of God, that the robber
should perish in those very plains which he had presumed to desolate.
Exult now, oh Province, adorned with the carcases of thine
adversaries! rejoice, oh Liguria, at the heap of dead bodies! If the
harvest of corn is denied thee, the harvest of dead enemies shall not
be wanting. Tribute thou mayest not be able to offer to thy King, but
the triumphs which are won in thy land thou canst offer with pride.</p>

<p>'<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>To these triumphs must be added the lately foiled plunder-raid
of the Alamanni, so checked in its very first attempts that their
entrance and exit were almost one event, like a wound well and
opportunely cauterised. Thus were the excesses of the presumptuous
invader punished, and the subjects of our King were saved from
absolute ruin. I might indeed enumerate to you what crowds of the
enemy fell in other places, but I turn rather&#8212;such is human
nature&#8212;to more joyful themes, and revert to the point with which I at
first commenced, namely that the Sovereign who has saved you from the
hostile sword is determined now to avert from your Province the perils
of famine.</p>

<p>'In this new war the citadels are well-stored granaries; Starvation is
the dreaded foe: if they are closed she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span> enters; by opening them wide
she is put to flight. I know not what the world in general may think
of the relative merit of these two campaigns of our King. For my part,
though I recognise it as the mark of a brave man to have fought a
winning battle, I think it is something above mere human valour to
have conquered penury.</p>

<p>'In addition to these benefits the King has remitted one-half of the
taxes of the Province, that he might not sadden with the one hand
those whom he was gladdening with the other. Herein he compares
favourably with Joseph, who sold corn to the Egyptians, but on such
terms that they lost their personal freedom. Doubtless that holy man
was placed in a dilemma between the necessity of satisfying a covetous
King on the one hand, and that of rescuing a starving people on the
other. Still I must think that the Egyptian, whose life was preserved,
groaned over the loss of his liberty; and if I may say so, with all
respect to so great a patriarch<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>, far nobler is it to sell corn to
freemen who remain freemen, and to lighten their taxes on account of
poverty. This is really a gratuitous distribution, when both the money
with which to buy is handed over to you [by the abatement of tribute],
and a price is fixed on purpose to please you.</p>

<p>'The generosity of the State therefore will sell 25 modii, when the
peasant has lost his crops, at the price at which 10 are usually
sold<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>. Humanity has altered the usual course of affairs, and by a
strange kind of chaffering, but one which truly becomes a King, just
when the famished peasant is willing to offer us an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span> enhanced price
for food, we are directed to offer it to him for a smaller one.</p>

<p>'The King himself had seen your calamity, and thereupon bestowed on
you previously one favour. Now, on hearing of its continuance, he adds
to it a second. Happy calamity, which forced itself on the notice of
such an eye-witness!</p>

<p>'Now, oh Ligurian, rejoice in the good fortune which has come to thee.
Compare thy lot with the Egyptian's and be happy. He was fed, but lost
his freedom; thou art fed, and at the same time defended from thy
enemies. Joseph gave back the purchase-money to his brethren in their
sacks, showing a greater kindness to his kindred than to his subjects.
Our King shows no such partiality, but bestows on all the taxpayers
larger benefits than he did on his brethren. Happy age! in which Kings
may be likened, not to Kings, but to Prophets, and yet bear away the
palm.</p>

<p>'But that we may not longer detain you from the desired enjoyment of
the Royal benefits, know that our commands have been given to those
whose business it is to attend to this affair, that, according to the
tenour of this edict, the generosity of the Sovereign may penetrate
into your homes.'</p>

<p>[The same considerations which were applied to the date of the
preceding letter seem to require that this also be dated in 537. After
the raising of the siege of Rome (March, 538), by the despatch of
Imperial troops into Liguria, and the enthusiastic adherence of that
Province to the Imperial cause, a new state of things was established,
and one to which the language of this letter would have been utterly
inapplicable.</p>

<p>There are two events of which we have no other knowledge than that
furnished by this letter: the invasion of the Burgundians, and the
ravages of the Alamanni in the Province of Liguria.</p>

<p>(1) The invasion of the Burgundians seems, as stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span> in a previous
note, to have occurred in the spring or early summer of 536; so that
Cassiodorus could represent the invaders as surprised and disheartened
by learning of the elevation of Witigis. It no doubt formed part of
those hostile operations of the Frankish Kings described by Procopius
(De Bello Gotthico i. 13), the termination of which was purchased by
Witigis by the cession of Provence and the payment of a subsidy. It is
interesting to observe, however, that the Burgundians, notwithstanding
their subjugation in 534, and their incorporation in the Frankish
monarchy, are still spoken of as conducting an invasion on their own
account. This is just like the invasion of Italy in 553 by the
Alamannic brethren, and is quite in keeping with the loosely compacted
character of the Merovingian monarchy, in which it was copied by the
Anglian and Saxon Kingdoms.</p>

<p>(2) For the ravages of the Alamanni consult, as before stated, von
Schubert's monograph. This passage quite confirms his view of the
events connected with the overthrow of the Alamannic Kingdom by
Clovis. A remnant of the people, settled as refugees in Raetia under
Theodoric's protection, now, in the decline of the Ostrogothic
monarchy throw off their allegiance to his successors, and press
forward over the Alps to share the spoil of Italy. Witigis, however,
notwithstanding his struggle with Belisarius, is still able promptly
to repel this incursion; but it co-operates with the Burgundian
invasion and the inclement spring and summer of 537 to bring about the
famine in Liguria in the autumn of that year.]</p>

compliment to the reigning Emperor, the first Consulship that fell
vacant after his accession to the throne was (I believe invariably)
filled by him, and that though he might sometimes have held the office
of Consul before his assumption of the diadem, this was not often the
case. Certainly, in the instances given above, Probus, Carus, and
Diocletian held no Consulships till after they had been saluted as
Emperors.</p></div>

tax, and had a special State-chest (arca praetoria) for the proceeds.
(3) <i>Administrative.</i> The Praefect proposed the names of provincial
governors, handed to them their salaries, had a general oversight of
them, issued rescripts on the information furnished by them, and could
as their ordinary Judge inflict punishments upon them, even depose
them from their offices, and temporarily nominate substitutes to act

Marcellinus Illyricianus, qui adhuc patricii Justiniani fertur egisse
cancellos; sed meliore conditione devotus, a tempore Theodosii
principis usque ad finem imperii triumphalis Augusti Justiniani opus
suum, Domino juvante, perduxit; ut qui ante fuit in obsequio suscepto
gratus, postea ipsius imperio copiose amantissimus appareret.' [The
allusion to 'finem imperii Justiniani' was probably added in a later
revision of the Institutiones.] 'Sanctus quoque Prosper Chronica ab

have given elsewhere (Italy and her Invaders, i. 227), that the Comes
had military command in the Diocese and the Dux in the Province. But
on closer examination I cannot find that the Notitia altogether bears
out this view. It gives us for the Western Empire eight Comites and
twelve Duces. The former pretty nearly correspond to the Dioceses, but
the latter are far too few for the Provinces, which number forty-two,
excluding all the Provinces of Italy. Besides, in some cases the
jurisdiction appears to be the same. Thus we have both a Dux and a
Comes Britanniarum, and the Dux Mauritaniae Caesariensis must, one
would think, have held command in a region as large or larger than the
Comes Tingitaniae. Again, we have a Comes Argentoratensis and a Dux
Moguntiacensis, two officers whose power, one would think, was pretty
nearly equal. The same may perhaps be said of the Comes Litoris
Saxonici in Britain and the Dux Tractus Armoricani et Nervicani in
Gaul. While recognising a <i>general</i> inferiority of the Dux to the
Comes, I do not think we can, with the Notitia before us, assert that
the Provincial Duces were regularly subordinated to the Diocesan
Comes, as the Provincial Consulares were to the Diocesan Vicarius. And
the fact that both Comes and Dux were addressed as Spectabilis rather
confirms this view.</p></div>

passage (iii. 4, 5) Lydus appears to assign a reason for the fact that
the Praefectus Urbis Constantinopolitanae, the Magister Militum, and
the Magister Officiorum had no <i>Cura Epistolarum</i> on their staff; but
the paragraph is to me hopelessly obscure. Curiously enough, too,
while he avers that every department of the State (perhaps every
diocese) had, as a rule, its own Curae Epistolarum, he limits the two
in the Praetorian Praefect's office to the diocese of Pontica

to the Praefect, and finally was in effect destroyed by the corrupt

prosperitatibus</i> condidisti.' By an extraordinary error this sentence
has been interpreted to mean that Cassiodorus wrote his history of the
Goths after their prosperity had faded; and some writers have
accordingly laboured, quite hopelessly, to bring down the composition
of the Gothic History to a late period in the reign of Athalaric. It
is perfectly clear from many passages that Cassiodorus uses
'deflorare' in the sense of 'picking flowers,' 'culling a nosegay.'
See Historia Tripartita, Preface (twice); De Instit. Divin.
Litterarum, cap. xxx; and De Orthographi&#226;, cap. ii (title). I doubt
not that careful search would discover many more instances. It is only
strange to me that Cassiodorus should, by the words 'defloratis
<i>prosperitatibus</i>,' so na&#239;vely confess the one-sided character of his
history.</p></div>

Introduction, <a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>. The mention of interrupted peace, which evidently
requires not mere estrangement but an actual state of war, points to
the year 505, when Sabinian, the general of Anastasius, was defeated
by the Ostrogoths and their allies at Horrea Margi; or to 508, when
the Imperial fleet made a raid on the coast of Apulia, as probable
dates for the composition of the letter. Its place at the beginning of
the Variae does not at all imply priority in date to the letters which
follow it. It was evidently Cassiodorus' method to put in the
forefront of every book in his collection a letter to an Emperor or
King, or other great personage.
</p><p>
As for the tone of the letter, and the exact character of the relation
between the Courts of Ravenna and Constantinople which is indicated by
it, there is room for a wide divergence of opinion. To me it does not
seem to bear out Justinian's contention (recorded by Procopius, De
Bello Gotthico ii. 6) that Theodoric ruled Italy as the Emperor's
lieutenant. Under all the apparent deference and affectation of
humility the language seems to me to be substantially that of one
equal addressing another, older and with a somewhat more assured
position, but still an equal.</p></div>

According to Dahn (K&#246;nige der Germanen iv. 60-61), these lands had
been given in her lifetime by Theodahad's mother to the King, and are
now begged for by Theodahad. But why 'tot solidos pensitantes?' Why
should Theodahad receive both land and money? There seems no authority
for translating 'pensitantes' receiving. Probably the solidi thus paid
to him are mesne rents received by the King and accounted for to
Theodahad. On the whole affair cf. Procopius, De Bello Gotthico i. 4.</p></div>

Cassiodorus this would prove that in the Sixth Century free Italians
were selling their children into actual slavery. But I doubt whether
he really means more than that the children of the country people were
for hire as domestic servants in the cities. If so, the scene is not
unlike our own 'statute fairs' or 'hirings' in the north of England.
It appears from &#167; 94 of the Edictum Theodorici that parents could sell
their children, but that the latter did not lose their <i>status
ingenuus</i>. Must they then claim it on coming of age? 'Parentes qui
cogente necessitate filios suos alimentorum gratia vendiderint
ingenuitati eorum non praejudicant. <i>Homo enim liber pretio nullo

Both Victor and Procopius seem to place the conflict before the death of Theodoric;
Victor says <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 523. Probably therefore the fighting, the capture of
Amalafrida, and the death of her countrymen, took place in that year,
the year of her husband's death and Hilderic's accession. Three or
four years later (526 or 527), when her brother Theodoric was dead,
the imprisoned princess was murdered&#8212;a grievous insult to the young
Sovereign of the Goths, her great-nephew.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_668_668" id="Footnote_668_668"></a><a href="#FNanchor_668_668"><span class="label">[668]</span></a> These mysterious sentences, according to Gibbon, cap.
xli. <i>n.</i> 56 (following Buat), refer to Amalasuentha, and thus lend
probability to the story in the Anecdote of Procopius that Theodora,
out of jealousy, intrigued with Theodahad to have Amalasuentha put to
death. But whatever may be the truth of that story, this sentence can
hardly by any possibility refer to it. For (1) it is clear that this
letter was written at the same time as Theodahad's, which precedes it,
therefore after the arrival of Peter in Italy. But Procopius is clear
that Amalasuentha was put to death before Peter had crossed the
Hadriatic, whereas this event, whatever it be, is evidently a piece of
news which Gudelina has to communicate to Theodora. (2) This letter,
though purporting to be from Gudelina, is confessedly written by
Cassiodorus, and published by him at the end of his official career.
It is hardly conceivable that he would deliberately publish to the
world his connection with the murder of Theodoric's daughter and his
own friend and benefactress. It is remarkable, on the contrary, how
complete (but for this passage) is the silence of the Variae as to
Amalasuentha's deposition and death: as if Cassiodorus had said, 'If
you do anything to harm <i>her</i>, you may get other apologists for your
deeds; I will be no champion of such wickedness.' It is scarcely
necessary to remark that there is nothing in the wording of the
sentence 'de illa persona,' &amp;c. which makes it more applicable to a
woman than to a man. As Peter's embassy was ostensibly connected with
ecclesiastical affairs, there is perhaps an allusion in this sentence
to some scheme of Theodora's with reference to the Papacy. It is
possible that she may have been already working for the election of
Vigilius to the chair of St. Peter, and therefore that <i>he</i> is meant
by 'illa persona.'</p></div>

Italy.' Though upon the whole rejecting the story of Theodora's
complicity in the death of Amalasuentha, I am bound to admit that this
passage lends a certain amount of probability to the charge. At the
same time, the words in the next sentence, 'per divinam providentiam
omni suspicione deters&#226;,' are susceptible of an honourable meaning,
even if the death of Amalasuentha be alluded to. 'You and your husband
accused us of that crime. Now by God's providence we have been able to
show that we were guiltless of it [that it was done without our

correctly informed concerning it. Noricum and Pannonia at the time of
Valentinian's marriage must have been entirely in the possession of
the Huns; and on the dissolution of their monarchy Noricum at any rate
seems to be connected with the Western rather than the Eastern Empire.
As for Dalmatia, or the <i>Province</i> (as distinct from the
<i>Praefecture</i>) of Illyricum, the retirement thither of the Emperor
Nepos in 475, and the previous history of his uncle Marcellinus, point
towards the conclusion that this Province was then considered as

The meaning of these mysterious words, as interpreted by Binding

Burgundians, received back from Amalasuentha (probably about 530, or a
little later) the territory between the Durance and the Isere, which
Theodoric had wrested from his brother in 523. The occasion of this
cession was probably some league of mutual defence against the Franks,
which Cassiodorus could without dishonesty represent as a kind of
vassalage of Burgundy to Ostrogothia. If so, it availed Godomar
little, as his territories were overrun by the Frankish Kings in 532,
and the conquest of them was apparently completed by 534 (Jahn ii.
68-78).</p></div>

des sinkenden r&#246;mischen Reichs, pp. 49-50) remarks: 'The relation of
the <i>Vices Magistratuum agentes</i> does not belong to the <i>Jurisdictio
mandata</i>. They are lieutenants (Stellvertreter) who are substituted
provisionally in the room of an ordinary official of the Empire or of
a Province, on account of his being temporarily disqualified or
suspended from office by the Emperor or Praetorian Praefect. The
municipal magistrates were also represented by <i>vices agentes</i>. But
the extant authorities give us no very clear information as to their
position.' Unfortunately this letter, relating to a <i>vices agens</i> of
the Praetorian Praefect himself, does not add much to our
information.</p></div>

difficult sentence: 'Si quos etiam fidejussoribus committere
necessarium aestimaveris, confidenter assume: quia illud magis
relevare potest animum nostrum, si aliquid per vos cognoscimus
impletum.' Cassiodorus seems to be urging his deputy not to shrink
from the exercise of even the most stringent rights inherent in his
office, in order that causes may be terminated without reference to
him. But is there authority for such a translation of the words
'fidejussoribus committere?'</p></div>

celebrated letter to which Venetian historians point as evidence of
the existence of their city (or at least of the group of settlements
out of which their city sprang) in the Sixth Century. We may set side
by side with it the words of the Anonymous Geographer of Ravenna (in
the Seventh Century), 'In patria vero Venetiae sunt aliquantae
insulae, quae hominibus habitantur.'
</p><p>
The address, <i>Tribunis Maritimorum</i>, looks as if there were something
like a municipal government established in these islands. Tribunus was
at this time generally, but not exclusively, a military title. Compare
the Tribunus Fori Suarii and Tribunus Rerum Nitentium of the Notitia
(Occidens iv. 10 and iv. 17). But there can be no doubt, from the tone
of this letter, that the islanders were subjects of the Ostrogothic
King.</p></div>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
